  <h1><a id="rel2.1" name="rel2.1">1. Release 2.1 - January 27, 2006</a></h1>
  <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
  <p>Fedora 2.1 is a very significant release of Fedora since it introduces the 
    new Fedora security architecture (with pluggable authentication and XACML-based 
    policy enforcement), the Fedora Service Framework, and many other new features.&nbsp; 
    The introduction of the new security architecture resulted in a significant 
    amount of code refactoring, therefore, Fedora 2.1 has been tested with an 
    extensive suite of new JUnit tests.&nbsp; Some of the system documentation 
    is still evolving.&nbsp; Most documentation is complete, but several documents 
    are still being enhanced and improved.&nbsp; To identify documents that will 
    continue to evolve, please look for an icon that says &quot;Draft Doc&quot; 
    under the document title.&nbsp; As revisions are made, we will publish the 
    most updated versions of these documents on the Fedora web site (<a href="http://www.fedora.info">www.fedora.info</a>) 
    and send alerts to the Fedora Users mail list.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This release 
    of Fedora was also tested against a large production testbed collection, where 
    bulk loading was performed on for a collection of 1million digital objects 
    with approximately 75M&nbsp; triples in the Kowari-based Resource Index.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </p>
  <p>Also, coinciding with this release is the publication of the <a href="http://www.fedora.info/tools">Community-Developed 
    Tools</a> page on the Fedora web site (see: <a href="http://www.fedora.info/tools"> 
    www.fedora.info/tools</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a clearinghouse for community-developed, 
    open-source applications, tools, and services that work with Fedora repositories.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    There are already many tools that are available, so check it out!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>A. Migrating from Fedora 2.1b</h2>
  <p>If you have previously migrated to the beta release of Fedora 2.1 and want 
    to upgrade to the final release, the move from Fedora 2.1b to Fedora 2.1 is 
    quite simple and does not require reloading of your repository.&nbsp; If you 
    are upgrading from Fedora 2.1b to Fedora 2.1 follow the steps found in the 
    Fedora <a href="installation.html">Installation Guide</a> and the <a href="migration.html">Upgrade 
    and Migrate Guide</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were a number of performance enhancements 
    and bug fixes applied since the Fedora 2.1b release; see the sections below 
    on <a href="#rel2.1b.features.perfpolicy">New Features</a> , <a href="#rel2.1b.bugs">Bug 
    Fixes</a>, and <a href="#rel2.1b.issues">Known Issues</a> for details. If you are starting from a release prior to Fedora 
    2.0, consult the Fedora 2.0 release notes and the Upgrade and Migration Guide 
    for instructions on how to migrate to Fedora 2.0 before upgrading to Fedora 
    2.1.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>  
  <h2>B. Migrating from Fedora 2.0</h2>
  <p>The move from Fedora 2.0 to Fedora 2.1 is quite simple and does not require 
    reloading of your repository.&nbsp; If you are upgrading from Fedora 2.0 to 
    Fedora 2.1 follow the steps below.&nbsp; More detail on these steps is found 
    in the Fedora <a href="installation.html">Installation Guide</a> and the <a href="migration.html">Upgrade 
    and Migrate Guide</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are starting from a release prior 
    to Fedora 2.0, consult the Fedora 2.0 release notes and the Upgrade and Migration 
    Guide for instructions on how to migrate to Fedora 2.0 before upgrading to 
    Fedora 2.1.</p>

  <p><b>NOTE: </b>&nbsp;Please be aware the base URLs for the Fedora SOAP interfaces 
    have changed in Fedora 2.1.&nbsp; The path names for API-A and API-M have 
    changed to facilitate better security management.&nbsp;&nbsp; The new path 
    names can be seen in the WSDL files for API-A and API-M and in the Fedora 
    Tomcat web.xml file.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="906045116-26102005"><font face="Arial" size="2">In 
    terms of impact on users, this change will only affect developers who have

      Open-Source License (ECL)</b><br>
      For version 2.1 we have decided to move from Mozilla Public License 1.1 
      (MPL) to the Educational Community License 1.0 (ECL). The main difference 
      between the two licenses is that the ECL imposes no compulsion to contribute 
      changes to source code. Our experience has been that consumers of our code, 
      both academic and commercial, see it as in their interest to contribute 
      code back anyway. In several cases, this requirement has been a barrier 
      for adoption of Fedora.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that this license makes the software 
      openly usable by anyone for any purpose. The only requirement imposed is 
      that anyone using our source code, making changes and distributing the changed 
      source, is required to make it clear that the new distribution is different 
      and to describe the changes made.&nbsp; Also note that this change only 
      applies to version 2.1. All earlier versions continue to be covered by their 
      original license.<br>

      for downloading community-developed, open-source tools, applications, services

      Service Framework<br>
      </b>As of Fedora 2.1, the<a href="../server/features/serviceframework.htm"> 
      Fedora Service Framework</a> is being introduced to facilitate the integration 
      of new services with the Fedora repository. <font style="font-size: 9pt">&nbsp; 
      The framework takes a service-oriented architecture approach to building 
      new functionality around a Fedora repository.&nbsp; While the Fedora repository, 
      itself, exposes its functionality as a set of web service interfaces, all 
      of these interfaces belong to the Fedora web application that runs in its 
      own Tomcat&nbsp;&nbsp; The new Fedora Service Framework allows new services 
      to be built around the core repository - <i>as stand-alone web applications 
      that run independently of the Fedora repository.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; While Fedora 
      repository functionality can still be extended with new modules, the intent 
      is to keep the repository service focused on the core functions of a repository.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Yet, there are many other services that are beneficial companions to a repository, 
      such as specialized ingest services, workflow services, preservation services, 
      and many others.&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the kinds of services that the framework 
      is intended to support.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two main benefits to the service 
      framework approach:&nbsp; (1) it allows new functionality to be added as</font> 
      atomic, modular services that can interact with Fedora repositories, yet 
      not be part of the repository, (2) it makes co-development of new services 
      for Fedora easier since each service can be independently developed and 
      plugged&nbsp; into the framework.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fedora development team 
      has developed an initial set of services (Directory Ingest and PROAI described 
      below), and will continue to develop new services over the coarse of Fedora 
      Phase 2 (205-2007), especially services for workflow, preservation, and 
      search.&nbsp;&nbsp; New services will be part of the main Fedora distribution 
      and will be kept up to date with new versions of the core Fedora repository 
      distribution.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members of the Fedora community will be collaborating 
      on the development of services and will contributed back to the Fedora Project.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Further documentation will be provided to establish guidelines on how services 
      should be designed to effectively plug into the framework.&nbsp; In the 
      mean time, developers of new services can follow the design patterns of 
      the Directory Ingest and PROAI services. <br>

      Security Architecture - Four Security Configuration Options for the Repository<br>
      </b>Fedora 2.1 introduces a configurable security architecture, that provides 
      options for SSL and authentication at the Fedora web service API level.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      There are <a href="../server/security/securingrepo.html#CONFIG">four base 
      security configurations</a> provided with the Fedora 2.1 server distribution: 
      (1) "ssl-authenticate-apim" configuration which uses SSL and enables authentication 
      for API-M, (2) "ssl-authenticate-all" configuration which uses SSL and enables 
      authentication for both API-M and API-A, (3) "no-ssl-authenticate-apim" 
      configuration which does not use SSL but still enables authentication for 
      API-M, and (4) "no-ssl-authenticate-all" configuration which does not use 
      SSL, but still enables authentication for API-M and API-A. Unlike Fedora 
      2.0, there is no longer a "default" configuration. Before starting the Fedora 
      server, you must run the new server setup utility (<a href="../server/cmd-line/index.html#setup">fedora-setup</a>) 
      to select a base security configuration that will initialize the servers 
      security configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp; After setup, you can customize that 
      base configuration as needed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The document entitled &quot;<a href="../server/security/securingrepo.html">Securing 
      Your Fedora Repository&quot;</a> describes the server setup process and 
      the nature of the different base security configurations.<br>

      Security Architecture - Authentication<br>
      </b>The Fedora repository server is built on top of Apache's Tomcat, and 
      authentication is channeled through the normal Tomcat mechanisms (e.g., 
      HTTP Basic Authentication, HTTPS Client Authentication).&nbsp; When you 
      select one of <a href="#rel2.1b.features.configs">Fedora's four security 
      configurations</a>, an appropriate rendition of the Tomcat configuration 
      file (web.xml) will be copied into the Fedora Tomcat configuration directory.&nbsp; 
      This configuration file will set up authentication for Fedora web services 
      (via &lt;login-config&gt;&nbsp; and &lt;security-constraint&gt; elements)<font style="font-size: 9pt">.</font>&nbsp; 
      Under the hood, Tomcat comes with different <b>Realms,</b> where a realm 
      is defined as a &quot;database&quot; of usernames and passwords that identify 
      valid users of a web application (or set of web applications), plus an enumeration 
      of the list of roles associated with each valid user&nbsp; [see: <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.0-doc/realm-howto.html"> 
      Apache Tomcat Realms</a>].&nbsp; </font> <font style="font-size: 9pt" face="Arial">Tomcat 
      defines a Java interface (org.apache.catalina.Realm) that can be implemented 
      by &quot;plug in&quot; components to &quot;connect&quot; a servlet container 
      to some existing authentication database<font style="font-size: 9pt">.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </font> Fedora 2.1 comes pre-configured with a customized JAAS Realm whose 
      purpose is to multiplex several authentication sources.&nbsp;&nbsp; By default, 
      Fedora's JAAS multiplexing Realm in configured to deal with a simple user/password 
      file.&nbsp; There is also support for acquiring user attributes from an 
      LDAP source.&nbsp; Authentication methods other than the two described here 
      are possible through Tomcat, but require configuring other Realm or Login 
      Modules obtained separately from the Apache Project or third parties, or 
      writing your own custom Realms or LoginModules.&nbsp; Additional user attributes 
      can be merged with those which Tomcat provides by configuring a site-written 
      servlet filter, which calls the Fedora API.&nbsp;&nbsp; For more details 
      refer to the documents entitled &quot;<a href="../server/security/securingrepo.html">Securing

    <li class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 9pt"><b> <a name="rel2.1b.features.xacml"></a>New 
      Security Architecture - XACML Policy Enforcement</b><br>
      A major feature of the new Fedora security architecture is the introduction 
      of the <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/access_control-xacml-2_0-core-spec-cd-04.pdf"> 
      eXtensible Access Control Markup Language</a> (XACML) and an XACML-based 
      policy enforcement module.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Developed by the OASIS Consortium, 
      XACML is an XML-based markup language to encode access control policies.&nbsp; 
      The policy language is flexible and enables the specification of fine-grained, 
      machine-readable policies that can be used to control access to Fedora web 
      services, Fedora digital objects, datastreams, disseminations, and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Since a policy is only worth its salt if it can be enforced, Fedora 2.1 
      introduces a new Authorization module implemented as part of the core Fedora 
      repository service.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Authorization module is built 
      upon the <a href="http://sunxacml.sourceforge.net">Sun XACML engine</a>.&nbsp; 
      Each XACML policy defines: (1) a &quot;target&quot; describes what the policy 
      applies to (by referring to attributes of users, operations, objects, datastreams, 
      dates, and more), and (2) one or more &quot;rules&quot; to permit or deny 
      access.&nbsp; Version 2.1 provides a Fedora-specific policy vocabulary for 
      referring Fedora operations and Fedora-specific entities within in XACML 
      policies.&nbsp;&nbsp; For a description of how the policy enforcment module 
      is implemented, see the document entitled &quot;<a href="../server/security/AuthorizationXACML.htm">Fedora 
      Authorization with XACML Policy Enforcement</a>.&quot;&nbsp; Regarding policies, 
      Fedora supports both repository-wide policies (that specify broad access 
      controls that apply to the entire repository), and object-specific policies 
      (that specify rules for a single object, and can even be stored within the 
      object in a special datastream).&nbsp; Fedora 2.1 comes out-of-the-box with 
      a set of <a href="../server/security/AuthorizationXACML.htm#DEFAULT">default 
      repository-wide policies</a> that establish baseline access controls that 
      are equivalent to what was provided in Fedora 2.0.&nbsp;&nbsp; These default 
      policies restrict access to the Fedora management web service (API-M) to 
      only the Fedora administrator, permit open access to the Fedora access web 
      service (API-A), and establish some other basic controls (e.g., allow access 
      to API-M only from localhost; restrict policy management to administrator).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      In addition to the default policies (which can be modified), any number 
      of custom XACML policies can be written and loaded into Fedora.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      For assistance in creating new policies for your repository and for your 
      objects, see the &quot;<a href="../server/security/XACMLPolicyGuide.htm">Fedora 
      XACML Policy Writing Guide</a>.&quot; <br>

      Policy Reload Utility</a> (&quot;fedora-reload-policies&quot; on the command

      without having to restart the Fedora server.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the addition 
      of the XACML-based Policy Enforcement module, there is the opportunity to 
      modify existing policies or add new policies over time.&nbsp; All &quot;active&quot; 
      policies must be stored in the active policies storage locations configured 
      for the Authorization module in the Fedora server configuration file (fedora.fcfg).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Once policies are copied into one of these &quot;active&quot; policy directories, 
      the Fedora server can locate them and load them into memory for policy enforcement.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Every time the Fedora server is started policies are loaded from the active 
      policy directories.&nbsp; &nbsp; It should be noted that Fedora supports 
      both repository-wide policies and object specific policies.&nbsp; The Policy 
      Reload Utility will load only repository-wide policies.&nbsp; For performance 
      benefits, object-specific policies are loaded on demand when the repository

      Security Architecture - Backend Security for Service call-backs<br>
      </b>Backend security is applicable to repositories that contain digital 
      object Disseminators that call upon external web services - <i>and where 
      a high level of security is desired</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Repositories that do 
      not use such external dissemination services do not require any custom configuration 
      of this new security feature.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> <font style="font-size: 9pt" face="Arial">The 
      term "backend services" is used to describe the set of web services that 
      are used by Fedora Disseminators.&nbsp;&nbsp; Disseminators are optional 
      components in the Fedora digital object model that allow for service-based 
      views of the digital object.&nbsp; A Disseminator points to a &quot;Behavior 
      Mechanism&quot; which contains a WSDL service description that is used by 
      the Fedora repository service to call upon an external supporting service 
      at runtime.&nbsp;&nbsp; These external services that Fedora calls upon are 
      referred to as &quot;backend services.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Fedora makes 
      a call to a backend service, it will typically send a reference to a datastream 
      (stored in a digital object in the repository) that Fedora wants the external 
      service to process in some way (e.g., a transformation of the datastream 
      content).&nbsp;&nbsp; When a backend service receives such a request from 
      Fedora, it must call back to Fedora to get the datastream content that it 
      is required to process.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is where backend security comes 
      in.&nbsp; If the Fedora repository is set up in a secure manner (SSL and 
      authentication), a backend service will be treated like any other incoming 
      client to Fedora.&nbsp; The service must make calls to Fedora in a secure 
      manner, and it may need to provide credentials to Fedora.&nbsp;&nbsp; To 
      support the secure interaction of backend services with a secure Fedora 
      repository, Fedora 2.1 provides a the &quot;<a href="../server/security/beSecurityConfig.html#CONFIGTOOL">beSecurity 
      Configuration Tool</a>&quot; for registering each backend service and specifying 
      how it should call back to Fedora.&nbsp; For more information on configuring

      </font> <font face="Arial" style="font-size: 9pt; "> The Resource Index 
      has undergone significant testing and a number of bugs have been fixed (see 
      Bug Fixes below).&nbsp; Most notably, a memory leak was discovered in the 
      Kowari triplestore software that underlies the Resource Index that was the 
      cause of reported Resource Index corruption problems.&nbsp; (It should be 
      noted that corrupted Resource Index can be restored using the Fedora Rebuilder 
      Utility that was pre-release to those having the problem in Fedora 2.0.&nbsp; 
      The Rebuilder is now part of Fedora 2.1.)&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been minor 
      changes to the Resource Index data model.&nbsp; This should be transparent, 
      unless you have written applications or middleware with static queries to 
      the Resource Index, in which case you may have to make modifications to 
      those queries.&nbsp; See the Resource Index Guide for more information.&nbsp; 
      Also with Fedora 2.1, a new indexing level is introduced for the resource 
      index.&nbsp; This new level (Level 3), will index parameterized disseminations 
      as concrete &quot;representations&quot; of digital objects, whenever there 
      is a fixed domain of values for method parameters.&nbsp; This is explained 
      in detail in the Resource Index Guide.&nbsp; Also, as explained in below, 
      the RELS-EXT datastream can be used more freely now, beyond just the expression 
      of object-to-object relationships, making the Resource Index more useful 
      for asserting community-specific properties about objects via RDF.</font><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: 700"><br>

      constraints<br>
      </font><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 9pt">In Fedora 2.0, the Relationships 
      datastream in an object (identified as &quot;RELS-EXT&quot;) was reserved 
      for assertions of object-to-object relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, in Fedora 
      2.1, the RELS-EXT datastream can be used as a means of creating extensible 
      properties for digital objects (i.e., properties not defined in the FOXML 
      schema).&nbsp; The benefit of putting such properties in the RELS-EXT datastream 
      is that the are automatically indexed in the Resource Index, and thus are 
      searchable via the RISearch interface.&nbsp; Previously, the RELS-EXT datastream 
      was validated by Fedora to ensure that every assertion was of the form&nbsp; 
      &quot;<i>PID</i> -- <i>relationship</i> -- <i>anotherPID</i>&quot;</font><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: 700">&nbsp; 
      </font><font face="Arial" style="font-size: 9pt">where the subject was the 
      PID of the object containing the assertion, the predicate a relationship, 
      and the object of the predicate was the PID of another Fedora object.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      New in Fedora 2.1 is that validation of the RELS-EXT datastream has been 
      relaxed so that it can be used to assert other kinds of custom properties 
      about the digital object.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifically, the object of 
      the predicate of an assertion does NOT have to be another Fedora PID;&nbsp; 
      it can be any URI or literal value.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus RELS-EXT can be used 
      to associate properties defined in any ontology with a Fedora digital object.&nbsp; 
      The example below shows the content of a RELS-EXT datastream with three 
      assertions about the Fedora object &quot;demo:99.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
      assertions are: (1) a object-to-object relationship defined in the Fedora 
      ontology namespace that says &quot;demo:99&quot; is member of the collection 
      object identified by &quot;demo:c1&quot;&nbsp; (2) <i><b>a relationship 
      (myns:isPartOf) defined in custom namespace that says &quot;demo:99&quot; 
      is part of a non-Fedora entity identified by &quot;doi:10.123/456<font style="font-size: 9pt">&quot; 
      </font></b></i>and (3) <i><b>an object property (myns:owner) defined in 
      custom namespace that has a value of&nbsp; &quot;Jane Doe.&quot;</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The second and third assertions are examples of what is newly supported 
      in Fedora 2.1 that was not previously supported.&nbsp;&nbsp; The second 
      assertion is in the form &quot;<i>PID</i> -- <i>someRelationshipName</i> 
      -- <i>someURI</i>&quot; and the third assertion is in the form of&nbsp; 
      &quot;<i>PID</i> -- <i>somePropertyName</i> -- <i>someLiteralValue.</i>&quot;<br>

      files reside.&nbsp;&nbsp; The utility can rebuild the SQL database (registries, 
      search tables, and other tables), the Resource Index, or both.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      This is useful for a number of purposes, such as migrating from Fedora 2.0 
      to Fedora 2.1, and also if a database or index becomes corrupted.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Additionally, if the Fedora administrator want to change from using the 
      McKoi database to using the MySQL database, (or from MySQL to McKoi) the 
      existing database can be purged, the fedora configuration file (fedora.fcfg) 
      can be edited, and the fedora-rebuild utility can then be run to correctly 
      populate the tables in the new database system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, the 
      fedora Rebuild Utility can also be useful for rebuilding the Kowari triplestore 
      of the Resource-Index if a problem or corruption occurs.<br>

      was reported when Fedora XACML-based policy enforcement was enabled in Fedora 
      2.1b. This was traced to Fedora's XACML attribute finder module that gets 
      information from a Fedora object when evaluating an XACML policy. The problem 
      was traced to the lack of caching of digital object readers for the duration 
      of a Fedora API request. During the processing of a Fedora API request, 
      the policy enforcement module obtains an instance of a digital object reader 
      to get attributes of the object. A new reader was instantiated for every 
      object attribute that was needed for a particular XACML policy. This resulted 
      in FOXML XML files being parsed numerous times for one API request. The 
      fix was to ensure that a cached instance of the digital object reader was 
      available for the duration of the API request, thus eliminating the excessive 
      and wasteful file I/O and SAX parsing. &nbsp;</font></li>

      In the Fedora Rebuild Utility (fedora-rebuild) the SQL Rebuild had degrading 
      performance for rebuilds of very large repositories. The SQL Rebuild code 
      did not properly set server logging and therefore kept all of its log messages 
      in memory while the rebuild was running. This explains why users were not 
      seeing server log files while the SQL rebuild was happening, and also explains 
      the excessive java heap size in later stages of the rebuild. This problem 
      was fixed by setting the logging to go to its proper location on disk..

      Within the Fedora's API-M modify operations (e.g., modifyObject, modifyDatastream, 
      and modifyDisseminator), the use of <i><b>null</b></i> as the <i><b>value</b></i> 
      for parameters on these operations was not handled consistently.&nbsp; As 
      of Fedora 2.1,&nbsp; a null parameter value always means that NO change

      parameter value is targeting.&nbsp;&nbsp; The prior value for that property 
      will be retained as is in the repository.&nbsp; In contrast, when a modify

      a parameter value of the empty string (i.e., &quot;&quot;), then the value

      <br>
      </b>When ingesting an object and a failure occurs after the object is initially 
      registered, the registry entries in the sql db table doRegistry are not 
      properly backed out. The result is that PID entries are left in the doRegistry 
      table so that subsequent attempts to re-ingest will fail with the error 
      being that the PID already exists.&nbsp; bug had to do with Exception handling 
      during the ingest sequence. The bug was introduced with code changes related 
      to Fedora 2.0. The occurence of this bug in the 2.0 release should be rare 
      but could occur if a fatal error occurred with the sql database transactions 
      during the ingest sequence after the object had been registered. The symptom 
      would be a failed ingest and then the inability to re-ingest the same object 
      after the failure without manually removing the PID entry from the doRegistry 
      table.Exception handling has been modified in DOManager and DOWriter to 
      account for this scenario and properly backout any entries in the doRegistry 
      table. Exceptionon handling has been modified in DOManager and DOWriter 
      to account for this scenario and properly backout any entries in the doRegistry

      solution was to remove the WHERE clause altogether. Fixing this issue also 
      revealed another oracle-related bug where the SQLRebuilder was previously 
      attempting to remove rows from ALL tables returned by getDatabaseMetadata. 
      This works fine in MySQL because the list of tables is isolated to the fedora 
      database.The problem is that this command in Oracle returns MANY non-Fedora 
      tables (system tables, etc) from this method. In effect, this was attempting 
      to remove all tables, even those from other tablespaces in the Oracle installation.

      Fedora to authenticate the API-A service, then you should NOT set the Fedora

      Disseminators with external services require that external services be able

      When an external web service tries to call back to the Fedora, repository,&nbsp; 
      there must be a publicly registered domain name for the Fedora server or 
      else the external service will not be able to contact the repository.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      To avoid this problem, change the Fedora server hostname in the Fedora server 
      configuration file (fedora.fcfg) to a registered domain name.&nbsp; Note 
      that if you are running as LOCALHOST when API-A authentication is ON, you

      is required for optimal performance and memory management.&nbsp; Testing 
      of Kowari has shown that performance on a 32 bit architecture degrades when 
      the Kowari triplestore get to approximately 50M triples, but that with a

  <p>Users migrating from Fedora Release 1.2.1 need to follow the steps outlined 
    in the section entitled, Migrating From Fedora 1.2.1 to Fedora 2.0, and apply 
    patch number 2 to their existing Fedora 1.2.1 repository BEFORE attempting 
    migration to Fedora 2.0. Failure to do so can severely limit future migration 
    options.</p>
  <p>If you are running a version of the Fedora software prior to version 1.2.1, 
    you will need to migrate your server software up to version 1.2.1 first, and 
    then proceed with the migration from Fedora 1.2.1 to Fedora 2.0. Steps for 
    migrating to Fedora 1.2.1 can be found in the release notes section for Fedora 
    1.2.1.</p>

    <h2><a name="rel2.0.features" id="rel2.0.features"></a>B. New Features</h2>
    <ol>
      <li> <a name="rel2.0.features.foxml"></a><b>Fedora Object XML (FOXML)</b> 
        <p>A new XML schema has been developed that provides a simple and unambiguous 
          expression of the Fedora digital object model. Previously, Fedora digital 
          objects could only be expressed in XML using an extension of the METS 
          schema. FOXML is the new internal storage format for digital objects 
          inside a Fedora repository. However, Fedora supports both METS and FOXML 
          as ingest and export formats (see #2 below). The introduction of FOXML 
          was motivated by several requirements: (1) simplicity - user feedback 
          called for a conceptually easy mapping of the Fedora concepts to an 
          XML format. Users wanted an obvious sense of how to create Fedora ingest 
          files, especially those who are not familiar with formats such as METS 
          and DIDL, (2) optimization and performance - the FOXML schema was designed 
          to improve repository performance, both at ingest and during disseminations. 
          Overall ingest performance has been positively affected with FOXML, 
          especially in the validation phases, (3) flexibility - internal storage 
          of FOXML enables easier evolution of functionality in the Fedora repository, 
          without relying on Fedora-specific extensions to the METS schema. FOXML 
          also introduces several new features to the Fedora Object Model including, 
          the ability to store alternate identifiers for datastreams, and the 
          ability to store format URIs for datastreams and objects (i.e., in anticipation 
          of services such as the Global Digital Format Registry (GDRF). Refer 
          to the user documentation for more details about FOXML and new features 
          of the Fedora Object Model.</p>
        <p>The XML schema for FOXML is available at:</p>
        <p><a href=

      </li>
      <li> <a name="rel2.0.features.format"></a><b>Ingest and Export with Different 
        XML Formats</b> 
        <p>The Fedora project is committed to providing repository ingest and 
          export functions that are compatible with community developed standards 
          for digital object XML encoding. This is motivated by both interoperability 
          and digital preservation concerns, where flexibility in the transmission 
          format of digital objects is an important feature. In support of this, 
          the ingest and export operations of API-M have been redesigned to allow 
          submission and retrieval of digital objects in several alternative XML 
          formats. In release 2.0, digital objects can be ingested and exported 
          in either METS (Fedora extension) or FOXML. In future releases, we will 
          add support for METS 1.3 and MPEG21/DIDL. Internally, the Fedora repository 
          system provides a translation module that is responsible for mapping 
          digital objects to the different supported formats. See the new "Ingest 
          and Export Guide" in the system documentation for more details.</p>
      </li>
      <li> <a name="rel2.0.features.relmeta"></a><b>Relationship Metadata for 
        Digital Objects</b> 
        <p>Fedora now supports the assertion of object-to-object relationships. 
          Fedora digital objects can be related to other Fedora objects in many 
          ways. For example there may be a Fedora object that represents a collection 
          and other objects that are members of that collection. Also, it may 
          be the case that one object is considered a part of another object, 
          a derivation of another object, a description of another object, or 
          even equivalent to another object. Relationship metadata of this sort 
          can now be encoded in Fedora digital objects in a special reserved datastream 
          (identified as "RELS-EXT"). Relationships are expressed as RDF/XML. 
          Fedora provides a default relationship ontology that defines a set of 
          common relationships (see: http://www.fedora.info/definitions/1/0/fedora-relsext-ontology.rdfs). 
          Also, there is support for community or user-defined relationships. 
          The relationships datastream is automatically indexed by Fedora as part 
          of the new Resource Index module (described below), which provides RDF-based 
          searching of the repository, including object-to-object relationships.</p>
      </li>
      <li> <a name="rel2.0.features.ri"></a><b>Resource Index</b> 
        <p>The Resource Index Module provides an RDF storage and query service 
          for object metadata and relationships in Fedora. By default, the Resource 
          Index indexes object properties, datastream, and dissemination information. 
          In addition, user-defined, inter-object relationships expressed the 
          RELS-EXT datastream are also automatically indexed. Examples of relationships 
          between digital objects that may be expressed in the Resource Index 
          include well-known management relationships such as the part-whole links 
          between individual chapters and a book, and semantic relationships useful 
          in digital library organization such as those expressed within the Functional 
          Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR). The query interface is 
          exposed as a web service, providing the foundation for external services. 
          Refer to the user documentation for additional information about the 
          Resource Index.</p>
      </li>
      <li> <a name="rel2.0.features.modify"></a><b>Batch Modify Utility</b> 
        <p>A new utility has been added to the Fedora administrative client that 
          allows repository administrators to perform object modifications in 
          batch mode. The utility is built using the management API method of 
          API-M so that most of the API-M methods can be run against groups of 
          objects. The utility works by creating an xml-encoded input file of 
          modify directives. This directives files is then processed in sequence 
          to carry out the designated tasks. A sample batch modify directives 
          file is included in the distribution in the batch-demo directory. Refer 
          to the Batch Modify Utility user documentation for additional information 
          regarding the Batch Modify Utility.</p>
      </li>
      <li> <a name="rel2.0.features.report"></a><b>Repository Administrator Reporting 
        Tools</b> 
        <p>A new Reporting interface has been added for obtaining simple administrative 
          reports about objects in the repository. The interface consists of several 
          static queries that can be performed on the repository to obtain statistics 
          about objects. These queries currently include object counts based on 
          type of object, creation date, and pid namespace. Refer to the user 
          documentation for additional information.</p>
      </li>
      <li> <a name="rel2.0.demo.soapclient"></a><b>Example Client for Making SOAP 
        calls to Fedora APIs</b> 
        <p>A sample java client application is provided that demonstrates how 
          to make SOAP calls to API-M and API-A. This client is written as a single 
          java class that connects to a Fedora repository, and makes a set of 
          successive set of SOAP calls to ingest an object from a FOXML XML file, 
          then add datastreams, modify datastreams, export the object, and several 
          other useful examples. It is intended as a quick and easy starting point 
          for Java programmers who want to write their own clients to the Fedora 
          SOAP interface. The demo client is found in the Fedora 2.0 distribution 
          at: {FEDORA_HOME}/client/demo/soapclient. Programmers should examine 
          the file DemoSOAPClient.java. To compile the demo, run the script named 
          &quot;compile-demo-soapclient.bat&quot; (or .sh on unix). To run the 
          demo, run the script named &quot;run-demo-soapclient.bat&quot; (or .sh 
          on unix). </p>

      <li> <a name="rel2.0.features.libs"></a><b>Third party Library Upgrades</b> 
        <p>All of the major third party libraries used in the Fedora codebase 
          have been updated to reflect the most current stable versions available. 
          This includes updating the underlying tomcat server to tomcat version 
          5. For Additional details regarding new library versions, refer to the 
          <code>license.html</code> file in the distribution which has a complete 
          list of the new libraries.</p>
      </li>
      <li> <a name="rel2.0.features.tune"></a><b>Performance Tuning</b> 
        <p>Significant enhancements have been made to the Fedora server code to 
          improve ingest performance. These enhancements included both tuning 
          of the underlying relational database as well as tuning how ingests 
          are handled internally in the Fedora server.</p>
      </li>
      <li> <a name="rel2.0.features.apia"></a><b>API-A and API-A-LITE Changes</b> 
        <p>A general cleanup of the methods found in API-A and API-A-LITE has 
          been done to provide better consistency between the SOAP-based and REST-based 
          interfaces for API-A. The corresponding WSDL files have also been updated 
          to reflect the changes.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>getBehaviorDefinitions - the functionality of this method is replaced 
            with the revised getObjectProfile method which now provides complete 
            object info including behavior definitions and methods.</li>
          <li>getBehaviorMethods - the functionality of this method is replaced 
            with the revised getObjectProfile method which now provides complete

        </ul>
        <p>API-A Methods added or modified:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>getDatastreamDissemination - this new method replaces the functionality 
            provided in earlier releases using the getItem method of the Default 
            Disseminator to return the contents of a datastream. Use of the default 
            disseminator getItem method is now deprecated.</li>
          <li>getObjectHistory - this new method provides a change history for 
            a digital object listing each modification date when an object component 
            has been modified. This is an interim solution to provide some basic 
            information through API-A and API-A-LITE about the change history 
            of an object. Eventually we would like to provide more detailed information 
            from the Fedora audit records so one could obtain a detailed history 
            of what changes were made to specific components of the object.</li>
          <li>getObjectProfile - this method has been modified to return the complete 
            object profile for a digital object. The object profile now includes 
            all component information about an object.</li>
          <li>listDatastreams - this new method replaces the functionality provided 
            in earlier releases using the getItemIndex method of the Default Disseminator 
            to list the datastreams of an object.</li>
          <li>listMethods - this new method replaces the functionality provided 
            in earlier releases using the getMethodIndex method of the Default 
            Disseminator to list the methods of an object.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> <a name="rel2.0.features.apim"></a><b>API-M changes</b> 
        <ul>
          <li>logMessage parameter now exists on all object-modifying methods.</li>
          <li>Datastream altIDs attribute. Any number of alternate identifiers 
            can be specified for datastreams on creation or modification. This 
            information is currently maintained, but not acted upon.</li>
          <li>Datastream versionable attribute. A new boolean parameter that indicates 
            whether Fedora should make changes in-place or retain prior versions 
            on datastream modification. This information is currently maintained, 
            but not acted upon.</li>
          <li>New ingest method added. With the introduction of FOXML and support 
            for multiple ingest formats, an additional parameter was required 
            on ingest to specify the format of the file to be ingested. Valid 
            values for format are "foxml1.0", "metslikefedora1", or "default". 
            The format of "foxml1.0" specifies ingest files is encoded using FOXMLv1.0. 
            The format of "metslikefedora1" specifies the encoding is Fedora's 
            extension of METS. The format of "default" indicates to use the current 
            repository default format. Refer to the API-M WSDL for additional 
            information about the change. The former ingestObject method is now 
            deprecated.</li>
          <li>New export method added. With the introduction of FOXML and support 
            for multiple export formats, an additional parameter was required 
            on export to specify the format of the file to be exported and to 
            specify the context of the export. Valid values for format are "foxml1.0", 
            "metslikefedora1", or "default". Valid values for format are described 
            above. Valid values for context are "public", "migrate", and "archive". 
            A value of "public" produces an export file that is appropriate for 
            use outside of the repository (all datastream content can be obtained 
            via public callback URLs). A value of "migrate" produces an export 
            file that is appropriate for migrating an object from one Fedora repository 
            to another. A value of "archive" produces an export file that is a 
            standalone entity, where all datastream content is inlines (XML inline 
            and binary base64-encoded inline). Note that the "archive" option 
            is not implemented in Fedora 2.0. Refer to the API-M WSDL for additional 
            information about the change. The former exportObject method is now 
            deprecated.</li>
          <li>modifyDatastream now supports changing the mimeType and formatURI, 
            and altID.</li>
          <li>modifyDatastream and modifyDisseminator methods now support a "force" 
            parameter, which indicates that even if a data type contract would 
            be broken, Fedora should accept the change anyway.</li>
          <li>purgeObject and purgeDatastream now include force parameters. Currently 
            when specified as true, these throw an exception. This feature will 
            be implemented in a future release.</li>
          <li>Consistent parameter ordering. Parameter ordering of all the API-M 
            methods was adjusted to make parameter ordering more consistent. Generally, 
            the first one or two parameters identify the thing being accessed/modified 
            (object PID, datastream or disseminator ID). When "logMessage" is 
            relevant, it occurs just after any data parameters. When "force" is 
            relevant, it occurs last.</li>
          <li>The treatment of nulls versus empty strings in arguments for the 
            modifyDatastream and modifyDisseminator methods of API-M is now more 
            consistent. Arguments specified as null indicate that the original 
            attribute of the component is to remain unchanged. Arguments specified 
            as the empty string indicate the original attribute is to be set to 
            the empty string. Arguments specified as non-null or non-empty indicate 
            the original attribute is to be replaced by the specified value.</li>

      <li> <a name="rel2.0.features.pidsyntax"></a><b>PID Definition Syntax Relaxed</b> 
        <p>Prior to Fedora version 2.0, the syntax for persistent identifiers 
          (PIDs) was defined as a subset of the URN syntax, but was not strictly 
          enforced by the server software. In version 2.0, the PID definition 
          syntax has been relaxed to enable a wider range of possible PID values 
          and the server software now strictly enforces the syntax of incoming 
          PIDs.</p>
        <p>The following describes the syntactic constraints for PIDs in normalized 
          form. The only differences with non-normalized PIDs are that the colon 
          delimiter may be encoded as "%3a" or "%3A", and hex-digits may use lowercase 
          [a-f].</p>
        <div class="code"> 
          <pre>
  PID:<br />
  Length : maximum 64<br />
  Syntax : namespace-id ":" object-id
  
  namespace-id:<br />
  Syntax : ( [A-Z] / [a-z] / [0-9] / "-" / "." ) 1+
  
  object-id:<br />
  Syntax : ( [A-Z] / [a-z] / [0-9] / "-" / "." / "~" / "_" / escaped-octet ) 1+<br />
  
  escaped-octet:
  Syntax : "%" hex-digit hex-digit
  
  hex-digit:
  Syntax : [0-9] / [A-F]

      <li> <a name="rel2.0.features.passpid"></a><b>Including PID As Default Parameter 
        in Disseminations</b> 
        <p>When constructing complex user-defined disseminators that reference 
          disseminations from other objects, it is often handy to be able to pass 
          the PID of the data object on to the nested dissemination requests. 
          Prior to Fedora 2.0, the only way to accomplish this was to add a formal 
          User Parameter to the disseminator method and use it to pass the value 
          of the PID. This syntax is awkward since the PID of the data object 
          is already contained in the dissemination request. For example:</p>
        <div class="code"> 
          <pre>
http://localhost:8080/fedora/get/demo:999/demo:991/getMethod?userparm1=value&amp;userparm2=value&amp;pid=demo:999
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>In the future, we plan to make it possible for the PID of the data 
          object to be automatically passed as a parameter so it is always available 
          downstream as a valid parameter on any dissemination request. As an 
          interim solution to address this issue, Fedora 2.0 allows the PID of 
          the data object to be passed as a default behavior mechanism parameter 
          by using a special syntax of the DefaultInputParm element in the behavior 
          mechanism object. For example:</p>
        <div class="code"> 
          <pre>
&lt;fmm:DefaultInputParm defaultValue="$PID" label="The PID of the data object" parmName="PID" passBy="VALUE" required="true"/&gt;
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Specifying a DefaultInputParm with a default value of "$PID" will result 
          in the PID of the data object being passed on to the external service 
          defined in the behavior mechanism object. In the WSDL section of the 
          behavior mechanism object, reference the special DefaultInputParm as 
          you would other parameters. For example:</p>
        <div class="code"> 
          <pre>
  &lt;wsdl:operation name="getService"&gt;
    &lt;http:operation location="runScript.pl?pid=(PID)"/&gt;
       .
       .
       .
  
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>At run time, this will be translated into</p>
        <div class="code"> 
          <pre>
  runScript.pl?pid=pid-of-the-data-object
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>A similar syntax is available to pass the object URI of the data object. 
          If you want to pass the data object's URI, then specify a DefaultInputParm 
          with a default value of "$objuri" and this will be translated at run 
          time into</p>
        <div class="code"> 
          <pre>
runScript.pl?pid=info:fedora:/pid-of-the-data-object
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>where PID is the persistent identifier of the data object.</p>
        <p>The demo data object object named demo_SmileyStuff.xml and the associated 
          behavior mechanism object named demo_DualResImageCollection.xml provide 
          an example of the new syntax.</p>
      </li>
      <li> <a name="rel2.0.features.timestamp"></a><b>Syntax Of Timestamp Values 
        Extended</b> 
        <p>Prior to Fedora 2.0, the syntax of timestamp values was to the nearest 
          second. This range has been extended in Fedora 2.0 to include milliseconds 
          to capture versioning changes that occur in less than one second. The 
          new timestamp syntax is:</p>

    <h2><a name="rel2.0.bugfix" id="rel2.0.bugfix"></a>C. Bug Fixes</h2>
    <ol>
      <li> <b>Incorrect GMT Datetimes - Creation dates for objects do not appear 
        to have the correct GMT timestamps. (Bugzilla #52)</b> 
        <p>When objects were created, the GMT timestamps stored did not reflect 
          the correct time of object creation. This was bug in fedora.server.utilitites.DateUtility. 
          The time zone offset was incorrectly being applied to the creation datetime. 
          Objects now reflect the correct GMT creation datetimestamp.</p>
      </li>
      <li> <b>Managed datastreams inadvertently deleted - Under certain situations 
        managed content datastreams could be deleted when purging similarly PIDed 
        objects. (Bugzilla #53)</b> 
        <p>This was a bug in fedora.server.storage.replication.DefaultDOReplicator. 
          Managed datastreams are stored internally using an identifier that consists 
          of objPID + dsID + dsVerID. An errant regular expression was being greedy 
          in matching which could result in similarly PIDed objects being deleted. 
          The regular expression is fixed to prevent this from occuring.</p>
      </li>
      <li> <b>Errant space in SchemaLocation used by getnextPID - There is an 
        erroneous space preceding the SchemaLocation in output for getNextPID. 
        (Bugzilla #54)</b> 
        <p>The SchemaLocation in the xml header output when running the getNextPID 
          method of API-M and API-M-LITE contains an errant blank. This bug will 
          only cause problems if trying to validate the xml output from the server. 
          The errant space has been removed.</p>
      </li>
      <li> <b>Dublin Core description element missing from drop down menu in admin 
        GUI client. (Bugzilla #55)</b> 
        <p>The drop down menu for Dublin Core elements in the admin GUI does not 
          contain the description element. The description element has been added 
          to the drop down list.</p>
      </li>
      <li> <b>Unable to disseminate timestamped disseminations - Under certain 
        situations, attempting timestamped disseminations would throw NullPointerException. 
        (Bugzilla #56)</b> 
        <p>This bug only occurs when attempting timestamped disseminations using 
          user-defined disseminators (i.e., disseminators other than the default 
          disseminator).</p>
        <p>This was a bug in fedora.server.storage.SimpleDOReader. When datastream 
          state checking was added in Fedora 1.2, the section of code dealing 
          with populating the DisseminationBindingInfo class did not include the 
          new variable for datastream state. As a result this variable in the 
          class is never initialized which leads to the eventual null pointer 
          exception when attempting timestamped disseminations with user-defined 
          disseminations.</p>
      </li>
      <li> <b>Serializer fails on export of bMech objects. Exporting bMech objects 
        throws NullPointerException. (Bugzilla #57)</b> 
        <p>The problem was that the method that checked WSDL and SERVICE-PROFILE 
          datastreams for instances of the local pattern "http://local.fedora.server" 
          did not have this pattern compiled. This caused a null pointer exception 
          when the xml datastreams were searched for this pattern. Bmech objects 
          now export correctly.</p>
      </li>
      <li> <b>Object Label updates not reflected in ObjectProfile - Changing an 
        object's label in the admin GUI is not reflected when disseminating objectProfile. 
        (Bugzilla #58)</b> 
        <p>This was a bug in the replicator where the object label field was not 
          being updated when the object label was changed in the object xml. Object 
          label changes are now properly displayed when disseminating the objectProfile.</p>
      </li>
      <li> <b>Timestamp information not displayed in all views of Default Disseminator 
        (Bugzilla #59)</b> 
        <p>Timestamp information was not being properly handled by the XSL stylesheet 
          that is used to style the output from viewItemIndex. This is now corrected 
          and timestamp info is properly displayed in all views of the default 
          disseminator (getObjectProfile, viewItemIndex, and viewMethodIndex).</p>
      </li>
      <li> <b>Date issues when Server and Client in different Timezones - Creation 
        dates for objects can be incorrect when server and client are in different 
        time zones. (Bugzilla #60)</b> 
        <p>When a Fedora server is in one time zone and a Fedora client is in 
          a different time zone, it was discovered that incorrect timestamps were 
          displayed by the client when retrieving objects from the server.</p>
        <p>If you open the object editor on an existing object and go to the Datastreams 
          pane, you will see that the created dates on the version timeline do 
          not match what's in the datastream at the server.</p>
        <p>Even though the admin GUI client is getting the creation data from 
          the server (via the java Calendar and Date classes), it appears that 
          the client evaluation of the values considers the system clock current 
          settings which are adjusted based on time zone. This is probably embedded 
          in the underlying implementation of the java Calendar class.</p>
        <p>The fix was to redesign the handling of timestamp information by both 
          the Fedora client and server. Fedora now standardizes on all dates PRODUCED 
          by Fedora as STRINGS in ISO8601 format: mm-dd-yyThh:mm:ssZ. This allows 
          Fedora to accept strings in mm-dd-yy or mm-dd-yyThh:mm:ss or mm-dd-yyThh:mm:ssZ 
          format, to keep backward compatiability.</p>
      </li>
      <li> <b>Problem when versions get assigned the same timestamp (Bugzilla 
        #64)</b> 
        <p>In certain situations when modifications to an object component occur 
          in rapid succession it was observed that a timestamp granularity of 
          seconds was insufficient and you could have two versions with the same 
          timestamp values to the nearest second. The solution was to extend the 
          value of timestamps to include milliseconds to prevent any potential 
          conflict.</p>
      </li>
      <li> <b>Inconsistent treatment of nulls versus empty string in arguments 
        of modifyDatastream and modifyDisseminator methods of API-M (Bugzilla 
        #68)</b> 
        <p>The treatment of nulls versus empty strings in arguments for the modifyDatastream 
          and modifyDisseminator methods of API-M is now more consistent. Arguments 
          specified as null indicate that the original attribute of the component 
          is to remain unchanged. Arguments specified as the empty string indicate 
          the original attribute is to be set to the empty string. Arguments specified 
          as non-null or non-empty indicate the original attribute is to be replaced 
          by the specified value.</p>
      </li>
      <li> <b>Error when editing disseminator label when using McKoi (Bugzilla 
        #76)</b> 
        <p>When attempting to edit a disseminator's label when using McKoi as 
          the underlying SQL database, the server would throw SQLException. This 
          error was due to a typographical error in the database column name being 
          used. Oracle and MySQL are case insensitive regarding column names, 
          but McKoi is case sensitive. This allowed dissemination labels to work 
          under MySQL or Oracle implementations, but fail with McKoi implementations. 
          The case of the column name is now corrected and works for all three 
          database implementations.</p>
      </li>
      <li> <b>Oracle error on ingest: cannot insert NULL into DSBIND.DS (Bugzilla 
        #77)</b> 
        <p>In certain situations when using Oracle as the underlying SQL database, 
          ingest would fail with SQLException. The cause was attempting to insert 
          NULL into the column dsBindKeySeq when no value was specified in the 
          object for this optional value. Oracle does not allow NULL for this 
          column type so the code has been modified to insert zero("0") when dsBindKeySeq 
          is not specified in the object.</p>
      </li>
      <li> <b>Editing object label containing apostrophe throws SQLException (Bugzilla 
        #82)</b> 
        <p>When attempting to edit an object's label containing an apostrophe, 
          the server responds with SQLException. The apostrophe character is a 
          special character that must be properly escaped in SQL INSERT statements. 
          Object labels are now checked for special characters and properly escaped 
          before issuing the SQL INSERT command.</p>
      </li>
      <li> <b>Oracle char(1) column types return with space padding (bugzilla 
        #85)</b> 
        <p>It was observed that when using Oracle as the underlying SQL database, 
          column types of char(1) would return with space padding which could 
          result in errors downstream. This was not the case with McKoi or MySQL. 
          The fix was to change the db schema column type to use varchar(1) instead 
          of char(1) everywhere in the db schema.</p>
      </li>
      <li> <b>Object label containing ampersand character throws Exception when 
        attempting to disseminate getObjectProfile method (bugzilla #86)</b> 
        <p>It was observed that creating an object with a label containing the 
          ampersand character would later cause the dissemination of the getObjectProfile 
          method to fail. This resulted from special characters, like the ampersand 
          character, not being properly escaped when written to dynamically generated 
          xml served by Fedora. XML special characters are now properly escaped 
          before being written to the outgoing xml stream so ampersands and other 
          special xml characters can safely be included in object labels.</p>

      <p>For OAI requests, the code interprets both "from" and

      <span class="emphasis"><em>midnight beginning that
      date</em></span>. This is correct for the "from" parm only.
      The day-granularity "until" parm should be interpreted as
      "23:59:59pm ending that date". That way, an OAI request with
      equal day-granular "from" and "until" parms will return
      records for that date. Changes have been made regarding the
      way that the OAI "until" date parm is handled when using
      "Day" granularity. If Day granularity is being used, the date
      value for the Until date parm is modified to be Day +
      23:59:59. This means that when using Day granualrity,
      specifying the same Day for both "from" and "until" date
      parms will result in matching all dates between 00:00:00 and
      23:59:59 on that day.</p>

          Admin GUI client - Export dialogs are incomplete under
          MAC OSX implementation. (Bugzilla # 10)</h4>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>This problem shows up only on MACs in exports from an
      opened object. In contrast, the dialogs from both File and
      Export submenus (export one object, export by type) do work
      correctly, as with Windows. These correct cases are where the
      filename is selected programmatically (i.e., pid.xml).
      Exports from an opened object (either to export the object as
      xml or to export a datastream of the object) give dialog
      boxes which lack filename fields so the user has no
      opportunity to select the filename. Navigating with the
      dialogue to a directory with an existing file needs to match
      the needed mimetype, and selecting that file will result in
      overwriting that file's contents with either the object xml
      or the datastream contents, but without changing the
      filename. The JFileChooser dialog was not allowing entry of
      filenames in cases where that should be possible. The
      workaround was to, for these specific cases, default to the
      platform's native file dialog by using java.awt.FileDialog.
      Note that using the platform's native dialog is not a
      solution for all file dialog-related actions. JFileChooser
      still needs to be used in some cases because it has an option
      to only allow the choosing of directories, whereas FileDialog
      is limited in this regard.</p>

          Admin GUI client - Log file generated when ingesting

      <p>When performing multiple ingest objects by type operations
      in the same admin client session, the log file displayed for
      subsequent ingest objects all show the log file from the
      initial ingest object operation. Closing the admin client
      between ingest object operations produces the expected
      results. This behavior is a result of the code checking to
      see if the log PrintStream is null to decide if a new log
      file is to be generated. If null, a new log is generated,
      otherwise it assumes there is an existing log to be
      displayed. Although the closeLog method in
      fedora.client.ingest.Ingest closes the log
      PrintStream(s_log), it does not get immediatley garbage
      collected so can have a non-null value for some time period
      after being closed. The code has been modified to explicitly
      set the PrintStream to null after being closed to resolve

      <p>When creating an object using the admin GUI client that

      improper updating of the sql database in the case where a new
      disseminator was added to a data object, via the
      addDisseminator method of API-M, where the object had one or

      <p>Removing and then re-adding a datastream binding in admin

      fedora.server.storage.DefaultDOReplicator that had to do with
      the improper updating of dsBind table when the binding map of
      an existing object was altered. The xml was correct after the
      update, but replication was incomplete on the sql database.
      The end result before the fix was an incomplete update of the

      <p>If a datastream has a state other than Active and it is
      bound to a disseminator or if already bound and the binding

      fedora.server.storage.DefaultDOReplicator that had to do with
      the updating of dsBind table when creating or modifying
      datastream bindings. The datastream state is correct in the
      xml, but the replication is incorrect in the sql database.
      Before the fix, the state of the updated bindings was always
      being set to "A" so if the state of a datastream was other
      than "A" and a binding that used that datastream was
      created/modified, the state in the sql database was reset to
      "A". The state of the datastream in the xml is now used to
      set the state when creating or updating a binding map. This

        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Fedora stores the definitive copy of objects as xml, but
      for performance also replicates a copy of objects in an sql
      database. With xml, there are no limitations on the length of
      attribute values or content. However, the sql database does
      impose field lengths which restrict the length of identifiers
      and labels. Users reported the truncation of some identifers
      in the sql database as a result of having identifier strings
      in the xml that exceeded the database schema field lengths.
      The xml validation code has been modified to verify the
      length of Fedora identifiers. Exceptions are now thrown at
      ingest time if any identifiers in the xml exceed the field
      lengths specified for those fields in the database schema.
      Currently, the validation is only applied to identifiers.
      Descriptive fields like labels, will be be truncated if they
      exceed the database schema field lengths. We will consider
      extending the validation checking to labels in the next

    additions to the Fedora Administrator client to enable object
    creation and editing. With the advent of content versioning,
    the Fedora Access interfaces now support date-time stamped
    requests, so that a client can "go back in time" and see a
    digital object as it looked in the past. Additionally, this
    release provides a migration utility for mass export and mass
    ingest of objects from either directories or other
    repositories. The migration utility enables the moving of
    objects from older versions of Fedora repositories into the
    lastest version. It also is of general utility for copying or
    moving objects among repositories, for unloading repositories,
    and for bulk ingest of objects.</p>

      versions of Fedora at the interface definition level, there
      are changes to the underlying database schema that require
      digital objects to be migrated from an old Fedora
      installation to the new Fedora installation. If you want to
      keep digital objects from an old repository and migreate them
      to the new Fedora 1.2 repository, you must run the migration
      utility provided with Fedora 1.2. DO NOT INSTALL FEDORA 1.2
      ON TOP OF THE PREVIOUS RELEASE. To upgrade from a previous
      release and migrate digital objects into the new repository
      follow these steps:</p>

          <p>2. initialize a new database for Fedora 1.2 using the
          database configuration scripts which are set up with new

          (or your own new database name that differs from the name
          used in your pre-existing Fedora installation. For McKoi,
          run the mkoi-init.bat (.sh for unix) which has a new
          default port number for Fedora 1.2.</p>

          <p>3. set a different port for Fedora 1.2 to run on

        modifying, inactivating, and deleting components of digital

        <p>The Fedora content versioning system is enabled with the
        release of Fedora 1.2. Now, any modifications made to a
        Datastream or Disseminator through the Fedora management
        interface (API-M) will automatically result in a new
        version of that Datastream or Disseminator being created by
        Fedora. The Fedora repository maintains all versions of all
        Datastreams and Disseminators, thereby creating a history
        of how objects change over time. Additionally, Fedora
        maintains an audit trail record of the nature of the object
        change events (e.g., who, what, when, why).</p>

        </div>

        <p>The new content versioning features can be easily
        accessed via new menu items in the Fedora Administrator
        client. The new object editor features (i.e., File/New,
        File/Open) provide the ability to create and maintain
        digital objects through a graphical user interface. Using
        these menu items, the user can create a new digital object,
        as well as add/modify/delete Datastreams and Disseminators,
        and view the different versions of these components. For
        details see the <a href="../client/admin-gui/index.html"

            Date-Time-stamped Access Requests.</h4>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Building on the capabilities of the new content
        versioning features, the Fedora repository will now support
        time-stamped disseminations and API-A requests. This
        enables a client accessing Fedora to be able to request a
        view of a digital object as it looked at a particular point
        in time. The syntax for using date-time in access requests
        is documented in the <a href=
        "../client/servlet/soapclient/index.html" target=
        "_top">Client Documentation for API-A</a> and <a href=
        "../client/browser/apialite/index.html" target=
        "_top">API-A-Lite</a> as well as in the <a href=
        "http://www.fedora.info/definitions/1/0/api/" target=
        "_top">WSDL API documents.</a></p>

        <p>The algorithm Fedora uses to evaluate date-time-stamped
        requests is an "as of date" approach, meaning that the
        repository will return a view of content as it looked "as
        of" a particular date-time. The date-time stamp provided by
        the client is interpreted by Fedora as a "ceiling"
        threshold. As such, the repository will evaluate the
        version dates on Datastreams and Disseminators and return
        the view of content that is as close to the requested
        date-time without being greater than the requested
        date-time.</p>

            Migration Utility.</h4>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>A new migration utility is provided to perform mass
        export and mass ingest of objects. At the core, the
        migration utility is built upon two newly enhanced
        command-line functions: fedora-export and fedora-ingest.
        Used together, these two command line functions can support
        a variety of scenarios involving moving or copying objects
        between repositories. The utility is general-purpose in
        that it can be used to copy or move objects among
        repositories for many reasons including upgrading from
        previous releases of Fedora. Client access to the migration
        comes in two forms: (1) run fedora-export and fedora-ingest
        at the command line, or (2) use the Fedora Administrator
        client to invoke these functions (see menu items
        File/Ingest and File/Export). Please consult the <a href=
        "../distribution/migration.html" target="_top">Fedora
        Migration Utility Guide.</a> to learn how to use the new
        migration functionality.</p>

            Externally-generated PIDs Accepted by Repository.</h4>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>A Fedora repository will now accept PIDs that are
        externally generated. To enable this feature, the
        repository administrator must modify the "retainPIDs"
        configuration variable in the Fedora repository
        configuration file (fedora.fcfg). The "retainPIDs" variable
        is a configurable parameter on the DOManager module. It
        defines the set of PID namespaces that the repository will
        retain during digital object ingest. If the repository
        receives an ingest request for a digital object, and a PID
        is provided (i.e., in the ingest XML), the PID will be
        accepted by the repository as the official PID of the
        digital object if the namespace of the PID is listed in the
        retainPIDs configuration variable. If the namespace is not
        found in the retainPIDs variable, the repository will
        generate a new PID for the digital object (and disregard
        any PID that may have been provided).</p>

            PID Generation via Management Interface
            (getNextPID).</h4>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>In Fedora 1.2 the PID generation module has been exposed
        in the Fedora Management web service. Formerly, the PID
        generator was an internal module accessible only by other
        modules in the Fedora code base. Now, client can use the
        getNextID operation to request new PIDs from the
        repository. This is helpful in certain workflows where it
        is necessary to know ahead of time the PIDs of digital
        objects that are yet to be ingested into the repository,
        and there is a desire to have Fedora generate these PIDs.
        The getNextPID operation is part of the Fedora Management
        interface. At this time, the operation is exposed
        exclusively as a REST-oriented binding, meaning there is a
        specific URL syntax for requesting PIDs. See the <a href=
        "http://www.fedora.info/definitions/1/0/api/#apimlite"

            Ingest exception "unknown protocol c" in Windows

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Under rare conditions in some Windows XP installations,
        an obscure exception is thrown during object ingest that
        reports "unknown protocol c." This bug was traced to the
        digital object validation module, specifically in the
        Schematron validation phase (see
        DOValidatorSchematron.java). The problem had to do with
        instantiation of stylesheets. In previous versions of
        Fedora, the Schematron preprocessing stylesheet was
        configured in the repository using a local file path to a
        location in the Fedora server (see fedora.fcfg). In some of
        the XP installations of Fedora, the XSLT processor had
        problems instantiating an XSLT stylesheet whose input
        location was defined with a file path. The problem was
        fixed by ensuring that all stylesheets are instantiated in
        a StreamSource object via a URL instead of file path.</p>

            Failure on database connections with MySQL
            3.23.53-3.23.58 on Windows.</h4>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>In particular older versions of MySQL on the Windows
        platform there is a problem related to case sensitivity in
        database names that prevents database connections.
        Specifically, if a database is configured (e.g., via the
        Fedora mysql-config script) with a database name that is
        mixed upper and lower case characters, the database will
        not be recognizable at runtime. In these older versions of
        MySQL, the mixed case database name is accepted at
        configuration time, and loaded into the MySQL system
        tables. However, MySQL then creates the actual database
        directory on the filesystem with all lower case. Thus, at
        runtime, there is a mismatch between what's listed in the
        MySQL system table and what's on the file system. In these
        offending versions of MySQL, the database is not found due
        to this case sensitivity problem. The work-around for this
        is to use all lower case characters in the database name
        (e.g., "fedoraobjects" ) when performing the database
        configurations. However, since the problem is fixed in
        Windows MySQL 4.x and later, it is recommended that Fedora
        administrators install the latest production version of
        MySQL (currently 4.0.16).</p>

        <p>Access to Datastreams via the Default Disseminator
        methods could fail for very large Datastreams in
        repositories running with limited memory. The problem was
        traced to sections of code in DefaultBehaviorImpl where the
        Datastream content was being passed as a byte array instead
        of as an InputStream. All code now streams content via
        InputStream classes.</p>

        <p>When two clients were simultaneously ingesting objects
        into a repository, an ingest failure would occur if the
        ingest requests hit the repository at exactly the same
        time. The exception reported by Fedora was that
        "temp-ingest already exists" which means that the temporary
        PID named "temp-ingest" was already in use. The problem was
        fixed by having all temporary PIDS appended with a
        date-time stamp, rendering them unique within a running
        repository instance. Now multiple concurrent client
        processes can run ingests against the repository.</p>

        <p>This has shown up periodically when clients are running

        Java throws a ConcurrentModificationException exception
        when you are iterating over something and trying to change
        it at the same time. The solution was to build a separate
        list of to-be-deleted items while iterating through the
        session list, and then, when finished, remove the
        appropriate items from the session list.</p>

        <p>In a METS XML file used for ingest, object state is

        Fedora repository will accept it as is. Therefore, if the
        value of RECORDSTATUS is set to anything other than "A"
        (Active), the object will NOT be accessible via the Fedora
        Access interface. In other words, the object will not be
        considered active, and it will not be able to be
        disseminated. If objects are ingested in the inactive
        state, the state can be modified via the new object editor
        in the Fedora Administrator client (see menu item File/Open

            Bug in MySQL v4.0.12 on Linux causes database
            corruption.</h4>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>The problem shows up only in Linux when running MySQL
        v4.0.12. Specifically, if a purgeDisseminator operation is
        run in the Fedora repository the problem is provoked.
        Normally, the purgeDisseminator operation removes a
        disseminator from a Fedora object XML store, and also
        initiates a replication process to make sure the
        disseminator is removed from the relational database object
        cache. Internal to the Fedora code, an SQL delete query is
        run via JDBC. The bug occurred when a the delete query was
        run. The query uses a where clause that should dependably
        evaluate to FALSE (i.e., "WHERE 1=2"), but in this
        particular version of MySQL under Linux, the query
        curiously and erroneously evaluates to TRUE. This
        particular query is intended to prevent certain rows from
        being deleted from the database. Instead rows are deleted
        resulting in referential integrity problems in the
        database. <span class="emphasis"><em>The solution to this
        problem is to upgrade to MySQL v4.0.14 or higher which does

            Field Search via API-A (SOAP binding) not backwards
            compatible.</h4>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Due to a type definition change in the WSDL for API-A,
        the SOAP binding for the field search operation (i.e.,
        findObjects) in not backward compatible across prior
        releases of Fedora. Thus, a search initiated via API-A
        (using SOAP) from a Fedora 1.2 client can not be fulfilled
        by a Fedora 1.1 or 1.0 server. In the WSDL for API-A, the
        findObjects operation defined a return type of
        fedora-types:FieldSearchResult (which is an array of
        fedora-types:ObjectFields). Formerly,
        fedora-types:ObjectFields defined an element named
        "locker." In Fedora 1.2, that element is now defined as
        "owner." Such interface changes are not accommodated by the
        Apache Axis library used to process SOAP requests. Fedora
        does not currently maintain different versions of its WSDL,
        so the change occurs in the "official" WSDL for the Fedora
        Access service. The problem can be bypassed by clients
        using the REST-oriented binding for the findObjects
        operation (see API-A-Lite in Fedora 1.2). The REST-oriented
        binding provides for a looser method binding, and allows
        the XML result be returned without type checking.</p>

    ("describeRepository") that enables a client to obtain
    information about the repository server.</p>

    <p>The new release is backward compatible with Fedora 1.0, with
    the exception of the Fedora server configuration file. If you
    are upgrading from Fedora 1.0, use you will need to enter your
    configuration values from the old Fedora 1.0 configuration file
    into the new configuration file provided with Fedora 1.1.</p>

    <p>Aside from this, the Fedora 1.1 software is compatible with
    pre-existing digital objects created in Fedora 1.0. There is no
    need to re-create or convert existing digital objects. Fedora
    1.1 can be configured to point at the existing file system
    location where Fedora 1.0 objects are stored, and to the
    existing relational database that contains information about
    the digital objects.</p>

    <p>** REMEMBER: Do NOT use the Fedora 1.0 server configuration
    file (fedora.fcfg) with the new Fedora 1.1 release.</p>

        service bindings refer to a "local service" that runs
        within the repository server, and (2) in objects that

            Failure of Batch Client Utility in UNIX
            Environment.</h4>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Specifically, a failure in running the Batch Build and
        Batch Build and Ingest menu items in the AdminGUI client
        when running the client in X-Windows. The batch utility
        could not correctly resolve file locations of
        object-specific files.</p>

        <p>REPORTED ERROR: Recoverable error.
        java.net.UnknownHostException</p>

        <p>FIX: The problem was traced to line 196 of
        fedora.client.batch.BatchXforms and has to do with the
        number of slashes in the file path (i.e., file:///).
        Solaris (and perhaps UNIX in general) wants only 2-trailing
        slashes instead of three. Places in the code where this has
        been a problem have been modified to ensure that any such
        URL strings are instantiated as a java.io.File object, then
        converted to a java.net.URI object. The URL string is
        finally obtained via the toString() method of the
        java.net.URI class. The strings generated in this manner
        are acceptable on both Windows and UNIX platforms.</p>

            Unable to Ingest Demo Objects when Fedora Server NOT on
            Port 8080.</h4>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>The problem occurs because the METS xml files for the
        demo digital objects contain URLs that assume that the
        repository is running on port 8080. The URLs point to the
        location of the demo content that is served up by the local
        repository server.</p>

        <p>REPORTED ERROR: [DefaultExternalContentManager] returned
        an error. The underlying error was a
        fedora.server.errors.StreamIOException The message was
        "Server returned a non-200 response code (404) from GET
        request of URL:
        http://localhost:8080/demo/batch-demo/thumb/americanacademy.jpg"</p>

        <p>FIX: There are two kinds of demos that are affected:
        "batch demos" that are loaded via the batch tool and "local
        server demos." The content for the batch demos has been
        moved to www.fedora.info where it will always be available.
        The METS xml files for the batch demo objects now have URLs
        that point to the demo content at this stable location. The
        "local server demos" are intended to be run completely
        within the local server context (meaning a network
        connection is not necessary to run them). The content for
        these objects must, therefore, remain local to the Fedora
        server. A new command line utility called
        "fedora-convert-demos" is provided to convert demo object
        xml files to reference the currently configured host and
        port. If the Fedora repository is configured to a host and
        port other than the default of localhost:8080, the
        "fedora-convert-demos" utility should be run before
        ingesting local demo objects into the repository. The
        "fedora-convert-demos" is found in the
        FEDORA_HOME/client/bin/ directory. Instructions on running
        the utility can be found in the Client Documentation
        section of the system documentation.</p>

            Failure of Server Start-up when Running with Java
            1.4.2.</h4>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>The Fedora server fails during initialization of the
        DefaultAccess module. DefaultAccess tries to use a
        dependent module (DOManager) that has not yet been loaded
        by the Fedora server. The problem does NOT occur in Java
        1.4.0 or 1.4.1.</p>

        <p>REPORTED ERROR: Can't get a DOManager from
        Server.getModule</p>

        <p>FIX: DefaultAccess is a server module, that itself needs
        access to other server modules. The DefaultAccess module
        initialization fails because DefaultAccess tries to access
        a dependent module (DOManager) that has not yet been loaded
        by the server. The problem is that server modules are not
        loaded in any particular order on server startup. Within
        any particular module's initModule method, you can't assume
        that ANY other modules are available from the server via
        the getModule(...) call. The solution is to move chunks of
        code like this to the postInitModule(...) method of the
        module in question. At THIS point in the server's
        lifecycle, you can assume that all modules have been loaded
        and are available via getModule(...), and that their
        initModule(...) methods have been called. Fedora server
        modules are listed in a HashMap. The reason that this
        problem showed up in Java 1.4.2 and not prior versions is
        that the order in which entries are put in a HashMap has
        changed in Java 1.4.2. It was just coincidence that the
        problem did not show up in prior Java versions (that loaded
        the HashMap in a different order.)</p>

            Hard-coding of Defaults for Server Host and Port.</h4>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>There were several places in the Fedora 1.0 code base
        where the default host and port of the server was
        hard-coded as "localhost:8080". This required the
        repository administrator to make multiple changes when
        configuring a Fedora server to run on a different host or
        port.</p>

        <p>FIX: All references to hostname and port are now driven
        off the fedoraServerHost and fedoraServerPort parameters in
        the Fedora server configuration file (fedora.fcfg). With
        this fix, a simple modification to these parameters and a
        re-starting the server is all that is necessary to change
        where the fedora server runs.</p>

            Remote Password-protected Datastreams Need to be
            Redirected:</h4>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Fedora 1.0 and 1.1 servers are unable to mediate access
        to remote datastreams that are password-protected.
        Currently, Fedora provides IP restriction for its own
        interfaces (API-A and API-M). However, at this time, it
        does not handle backend security handshakes with remote
        servers. Thus, when a digital object makes reference to a
        datastream on a remote server and that server protects its
        content with HTTP Basic Authentication, Fedora will not be
        able to negotiate with the remote server to access that
        content. The way around this is to make sure that such
        datastreams are marked with as type R (Redirected Content).
        This is done in the METS XML file by setting OWNERID=R on
        the METS file element that used to encode the
        datastream.</p>

            Behavior Mechanisms with SOAP Bindings Not Yet

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Fedora 1.0 and 1.1 servers cannot currently communicate
        with external web services that require the SOAP messaging
        protocol. This means that Behavior Mechanism Objects should
        not include WSDL that describes a service with SOAP
        bindings. In the current release, Fedora is able to
        communicate with web services that can be accessed via URLs
        using a simple HTTP GET (REST-style web services). The next
        release of Fedora will include a SOAP dispatching module
        which will enable the Fedora server to send SOAP requests
        to other services and receive SOAP responses from those
        services.</p>

          Repository-Managed Content Datastreams</h3>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>The implementation of Repository-Managed Content
      datastreams has been added. Repository-Managed Content is
      used for datastreams that are to be under the complete
      control of the Fedora repository. Upon ingestion, content
      that is referenced in the Fedora-METS "file" element is
      copied to an internal storage location in the Fedora server
      and the external pointer in the Fedora-METS object is updated
      to reflect the new internal storage location.
      Repository-Managed Content should be used in cases where it
      is desirable for datastream content to be stored and managed
      locally within the Fedora server. The repository manager must
      insure that there is sufficient disk space allocated to
      accommodate the ingestion of objects containing
      Repository-Managed Content.</p>

          Implementor-Defined XML Metadata Datastreams</h3>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>The implementation of Implementor-Defined XML Metadata
      datastreams has been added. XMLMetadata datastreams represent
      user-defined XML-encoded metadata that is included in-line in
      the "amdSec" and "dmdSec" elements of the Fedora-Mets object.
      Although these datastreams are included in the metadata
      section of the Fedora-METS object, they can be disseminated
      just like the regular datastreams included in the "fileSec"
      element. Implementor-Defined XML Metadata datastreams should
      be used in cases where it is desirable to include
      user-defined metadata in-line in the Fedora-METS object. The
      Dublin Core metadata datastream is an example of an
      Implementor-Defined XML Metadata datastream (see Search
      Interface note).</p>

          API-A-Lite Interface</h3>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>A new Fedora Access interface has been implemented known
      as API-A-Lite. API-A-Lite provides a streamlined
      implementation of the Fedora Access API over HTTP. The new
      interface provides two methods: GetDissemination, and
      GetObjectProfile. GetDissemination is used to request
      disseminations using HTTP. GetObjectProfile uses object
      reflection to provide a description of an object and its
      components.</p>

          Search Interface</h3>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>The implementation of a new search interface has been
      added. Upon ingestion, metadata from the Fedora System
      Metadata section and the Dublin Core (DC) Metadata section of
      the object are indexed in a relational database, and may be
      searched using this interface. The DC Metadata section is an
      optional Implementor-Defined XML Metadata datastream in the
      object, where the "Datastream ID" is DC, and the XML conforms
      to the schema at:
      http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd. If such a
      datastream is not provided, only the System Metadata will be
      indexed for that object. The search interface provides both
      simple and advanced searching via a web page included with
      the repository software. All queries are case insensitive.
      Simple search enables queries of words and phrases occurring
      anywhere in an object s indexed metadata fields. Advanced
      Search enables fielded searching across any combination of
      metadata elements using string comparison operators (= and ~)
      for string fields, and value comparison operators (&nbsp; =, &gt;, &#8805;, &lt;, &#8804; &nbsp;) 
      for date fields (dc:date fields may
      be treated as both). The wildcards, * and ? may be used in
      any string-based query.</p>

          Provider Interface</h3>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>The implementation of an OAI-PMH2.0 Provider interface has
      been added. OAI-PMH is a standard for sharing metadata across
      repositories. Currently, only the Dublin Core metadata for
      each object may be disseminated via this interface.</p>

          Access Control and Authentication</h3>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Although Access Control is not slated until year two of
      the project, the implementation of a simple form of access
      control has been added to provide a minimal level of
      security. IP range restriction is supported at both the
      Management API and the Access API exposures. The fedora.fcfg
      configuration file contains two new optional parameters in
      the Access and Management Modules named "allowhosts" and
      "denyhost" that are used to provide a comma delimited set of
      IP ranges. By default, the Management API is restricted to
      the IP address of the local host and the Access API is
      unrestricted. In addition, basic authentication is supported
      for API-M client-to-server communication. The client scripts
      and fedora-admin GUI have been modified to take a username
      and password at startup. Only one user, the super user
      "fedoraAdmin", is supported at this time. The password for
      fedoraAdmin is configured in fedora.fcfg.</p>

          Server Port Configuration</h3>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Server administrators can now more easily configure the
      port on which the Fedora server is exposed. The port is set
      in fedora.fcfg. Its default is 8080.</p>

          METS Extension</h3>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>To accommodate some of the new functionality in Fedora, it
      was necessary to extend the METS schema. Fedora-METS objects
      are now validated against this extended version of METS. The
      extended schema, mets-fedora-ext.xsd, is available at
      dist/server/xsd/ and contains inline comments where changes
      were made. Other constraints for the objects, expressed in
      schematron, are available in the dist/server/schematron/
      directory. The demonstration objects act as useful examples
      in understanding this schema.</p>

          Default Disseminator</h3>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>The implementation of a new Default Disseminator has been
      added. Prior to this release, a data object could not be
      disseminated without first constructing and ingesting a
      behavior definition and behavior mechanism object. The
      Default Disseminator is a built-in internal disseminator on
      every object that provides an internal behavior mechanism for
      disseminating the basic contents of an object. The Default
      Disseminator does not replace Behavior Definition and
      Behavior Mechanism object. Instead, it provides a simple way
      for viewing the contents of an object without having to
      construct a separate Behavior Definition and Behavior
      Mechanism object. Behavior Definition and Behavior Mechanism
      objects are still required for creating disseminations that
      provide more complex sets of behaviors.</p>

          Storage Subsystem Enhancements</h3>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>The code supporting the Java instantiation of Fedora
      Digital Objects inside the server has been re-worked so that
      serialization and deserialization are completely de-coupled
      from the Java interfaces to the objects: the DOReaders and
      DOWriters. Method names have also been changed to be more
      meaningful and consistent. The serialization and
      deserialization code has been modified to support the new
      version of the Fedora METS extension schema (described
      above). Overall, the code in this portion of the server is
      more compact and robust than in the previous version of the
      software.</p>

          Batch Ingest Tool Enhancements</h3>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>The functionality to create and ingest batches of objects
      has been moved under the fedora-admin client tool. This
      consolidates administrative functions into a single tool and
      provides a readily accessible user interface. There are now
      more attributes which can be substituted, per-object, into
      the batch template. These include object label; datastream
      labels, both general and specific to a disseminator; and
      datastream title. An object comment can also be inserted.</p>

          New Demo Objects</h3>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>This includes new demonstration objects. These objects can
      be loaded into the repository in one of two ways. The xml
      source files can be "ingested" into the repository via the
      Fedora Admin GUI client (from the command prompt, run:
      fedora-admin). Otherwise, they can be loaded with all other
      demos by running the demo load script (from the command
      prompt, run: fedora-demoall [hostname] [port] [username]
      [password]). The demo object source xml files for the demo
      objects can be found in the following directory:
      [FEDORA_HOME]/server/demo</p>

      <p>There are two categories of demonstrations:</p>

      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Local Server Demos
            -</em></span> These demos can be run under any
            conditions. They are intended to work when the Fedora
            repository server is in a stand-alone condition, for
            example, if the repository is running without a network
            connection, or if the repository is behind a firewall
            and not set up to received outside connections.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Open Server Demos
            -</em></span> These demos can only be run if the Fedora
            repository server is running as a network accessible
            server, meaning that it can make outgoing connections
            AND accept incoming connections. If the repository
            server is running behind a firewall, the firewall must
            be configured to allow incoming connections on the port
            that the repository server is running. The Open Server
            Demos use distributed content and services that are
            remote to the repository server.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>Once demo objects are ingested into the repository, they
      can be viewed via a web browser using API-A-LITE or API-A.
      Remember the URL syntax to get the object profile via
      API-A-LITE is:
      http://{hostname}:{port}/fedora/get/{objectPID}</p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <p>This release adds several important features to the Fedora
    software, including a batch ingest tool, parameterized
    disseminations, and datastream mediation. Digital object
    serialization and PID generation are now fully active, and
    validation has been enhanced. This is a non-public release.</p>

          Batch Ingest</h3>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>A simple batch tool has been added, enabling the creation
      of a batch of objects conforming to the same content model.
      The tool consists of a 3 phase process. Phase 1 will take a
      directory structure consisting of datastreams and metadata
      and convert that information into an XML-encoded file. Phase
      2 will then take the XML-encoded file and merge that with a
      object template file that specifies the content model being
      used to produce a Fedora METS-encoded file. Phase 3 of the
      process then ingests the METS-encoded files and returns a
      list of the PIDs that were assigned to the new objects. Phase
      2 and Phase 3 are implemented in the beta1 release. Phase 1
      will be implemented in the next release and is NOT available
      in the beta1 release.</p>

          Generation</h3>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p><span class="emphasis"><em>PID generation has been
      activated.</em></span> Upon ingestion, Fedora objects that
      pass validation are automatically assigned a unique
      persistent identifer or PID. The namespace prefix on the PID
      is determined by the namespace parameter in the fedora.cfg
      configuration file.</p>

      <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Special default PID
      namespace.</em></span> To simplify initial setup and use of
      the repository, the default namespace of "test:" enables
      special handling of Fedora object PIDs. If the PID namespace
      is set to "test:" in the fedora/fcfg configuration file, the
      ingest method will NOT generate unique PIDs, but will instead
      use the PID values contained in the Fedora objects. This
      behavior occurs ONLY for the namespace of "test:". This
      feature was enabled to allow for easier loadeing of sample
      objects by novice users of the repository software.</p>

          Serialization</h3>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Objects are completely deserialized and re-serialed upon
      ingest. This has the effect that the stored version of the
      object (in METS form) will not be the same byte-for-byte as
      the version coming out, but the information will be
      preserved. It also enables more complete validation and PID
      generation.</p>

          Validation Enhancements</h3>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Two-phase validation of objects implemented. Upon
      ingestion, Fedora objects undergo a two phase validation
      process to validate against the Fedora METS schema and to
      validate against a set of rules defined for Fedora
      objects.</p>

          Parameters</h3>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Method Parameters
      enabled</em></span> Method parameters can now be defined in
      Behavior Mechanism objects using WSDL providing a way to pass
      parameters to methods from the end user. For example, an
      image mechanism might have a method named getImage with
      parameters X and Y that specify the pixel dimensions of the
      requested image. Method parameters may be supplied by the end
      user on a dissemination request to affect the result of the
      dissemination.</p>

      <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Default Method Parameters
      enabled</em></span> Mechanism designers can now create method
      parameters that are known only to the mechanism. Default
      method parameters cannot be altered by the end user and their
      values must be specified in the Behavior Mechanism
      object.</p>

      <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Enhancements to the example
      soap client (FedoraAccessSoapServlet)</em></span> In the
      alpha1 release, the soap client enabled one to reflect on an
      object using GetBehaviorDefinitions and GetObjectMethods to
      display a list of all methods for a given object and to
      disseminate each of the methods. This interface has been
      enhanced to now allow for user input of method parameters for
      those methods that define parameters.</p>

      <p><span class="emphasis"><em>DB Schema updated</em></span> A
      new table named MechDefaultParameter has been added and the
      datatype and length of some column names have changed.</p>
