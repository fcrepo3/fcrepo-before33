    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <span class="plaintext"> This is the installation guide for Fedora.
    It includes instructions for installing the server and client distributions,
    as well as instructions for installing and compiling the complete source
    code distribution. </span>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>
        <h3 id="intro.prereq">Install Prerequisites</h3>
        <span class="plaintext"> <strong>Required:</strong> <br />
        <em>Java SE Development Kit (JDK) 5.0.</em> <br />
        Whether installing a binary or source distribution, JDK 5.0 is required.
        The JDK should be installed on the machine you intend to use as the
        Fedora server. The JDK is available from <a href="http://java.sun.com/">http://java.sun.com/</a>.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Optional:</strong> <br />
        <em>Database</em> <br />
        The Fedora server is backed in part by a relational database. To
        simplify installation, the Fedora installer includes and can configure
        an embedded instance of the <a href="http://mckoi.com/database/">McKoi
        SQL Database 1.0.3</a>. Fedora also supports <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>,
        <a href="http://www.oracle.com/">Oracle 9</a> and <a
            href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>. If the included
        McKoi database will not be used, another database server must be
        installed, configured and running before proceeding with the
        installation. To configure Fedora to use another database, please see
        the <a href="#database">Database</a> section below for further
        instructions. <br />
        <br />
        <em>Servlet Container</em> <br />
        The Fedora installer includes Tomcat 5.5.23. Optionally, Fedora may be
        installed into any existing servlet container that implements Servlet
        2.4/JSP 2.0 or higher. At this time, Fedora has chiefly been tested with
        Tomcat 5.x but users have reported running Fedora successfully with
        Jetty and JBoss. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Additional requirements for building Fedora from
        source:</strong> <br />
        <em>Ant 1.6.5 or later</em> <br />
        Fedora uses Ant for its build environment. Ant is available from <a
            href="http://ant.apache.org/">http://ant.apache.org/</a>. </span></li>
        <li>
        <h3 id="intro.download">Download Fedora</h3>
        <span class="plaintext"> The latest version of the software can
        always be found at <a href="http://www.fedora-commons.org/">http://www.fedora-commons.org</a>.
        <br />
        <br />
        There are two download options: the Fedora Installer and the source code
        distribution. Unless you wish to build Fedora from source, you should
        select the Fedora Installer. </span></li>
        <li>
        <h3 id="intro.env">Prepare Environment Variables</h3>
        <span class="plaintext"> The following environment variables must
        be correctly defined: <br />
        <br />
        <strong>JAVA_HOME</strong> <br />
        This should point to the base directory of your Java installation. On
        Windows systems, this might be C:\java. For UNIX derivatives, this might
        be something like /usr/local/java-1.5.0-sun <br />
        <br />
        <strong>FEDORA_HOME</strong> <br />
        This is the directory where Fedora will be installed, for example,
        C:\fedora or /usr/local/fedora. <strong>PATH</strong> <br />
        This must include the Java and Fedora bin directories. For UNIX
        derivatives, this will be $FEDORA_HOME/server/bin,
        $FEDORA_HOME/client/bin and usually $JAVA_HOME/bin. For Windows, this
        will be %FEDORA_HOME%\server\bin, %FEDORA_HOME%\client\bin and usually
        %JAVA_HOME%\bin. <br />
        <br />
        If you will be building from source, Ant should also also be on your
        path. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>JAVA_OPTS</strong> <br />
        If Fedora is configured to use SSL, JAVA_OPTS must include the
        javax.net.ssl.trustStore and javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword
        properties. See the SSL section below for more information. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>CATALINA_HOME</strong> <br />
        If Fedora is configured to use Tomcat, CATALINA_HOME must be set before
        starting Fedora. If using the quick install option, CATALINA_HOME should
        be set to $FEDORA_HOME/tomcat (or %FEDORA_HOME%\tomcat in Windows). </span></li>
    </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
    <h2 id="installer">Installation</h2>
    <span class="plaintext"> The Fedora Installer provides three
    installation options: quick, custom, and client. <br />
    <br />
    To start the installer, change to the directory where you downloaded the
    installer and at a command prompt, enter: <br />
    java -jar fedora-3.0b1-installer.jar <br />
    <br />
    Please ensure that the user account that is running the installer has
    sufficient permissions to write to the directories where Fedora will be
    installed (if deploying to an existing Tomcat installation, this includes
    permissions to the Tomcat directory). Installer created files will usually
    be owned by the user running the installer. Consequently, for example, after
    installation users of the Fedora Admin client will need write permissions to
    the the installer created FEDORA_HOME/client log directories. </span>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>
        <h3 id="installer.quick">Quick Install</h3>
        <span class="plaintext"> The quick option is designed to get
        Fedora up and running as quickly as possible, with a minimum of advanced
        options. The quick install will automatically install a servlet
        container and database. Neither SSL support nor XACML policy enforcement
        is enabled by the quick install. </span></li>
        <li>
        <h3 id="installer.custom">Custom Install</h3>
        <span class="plaintext"> The custom option provides the most
        flexibility in configuring an installation. Options include the choice
        of servlet container, database, the host and ports Fedora will be
        running on, enabling optional services, as well as security options
        including SSL and XACML policy enforcement. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Servlet Container</strong> <br />
        The installer will automatically configure and deploy to Tomcat 5.0.x
        and 5.5.x servlet containers. However, if an existing Tomcat
        installation (as opposed to the Tomcat bundled with the installer) was
        selected, the installer will not overwrite your existing server.xml, but
        rather, place a modified copy at FEDORA_HOME/install so that you may
        review it before before installing it yourself. <br />
        <br />
        Other servlet containers will require manual deployment of the .war
        files located at FEDORA_HOME/install. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>SSL</strong> <br />
        Configuring SSL support for Fedora's API-M interface is strongly
        recommended for production environments. <br />
        <br />
        If the Tomcat servlet container is selected, the installer will
        configure server.xml for you. However, as noted above, if an existing
        Tomcat installation was selected, the installer will not overwrite your
        existing server.xml. <br />
        <br />
        Please consult your servlet container's documentation for certificate
        generation and installation. (In particular, the example certificate
        provided by the installer for Tomcat should not be used in a production
        environment). <br />
        <br />
        If Fedora is configured to use SSL, the JAVA_OPTS environment variable
        must include the javax.net.ssl.trustStore and
        javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword properties. The value of
        javax.net.ssl.trustStore should be the location of the truststore file
        and the value of javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword is the password for
        the keystore. The following values may be used with the sample keystore
        included with the installer: <code class="block"> <pre>
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=$FEDORA_HOME/server/truststore-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=tomcat
</pre> </code> <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Resource Index</strong> <br />
        If the <a href="../server/resourceIndex/index.html">Resource Index</a> is enabled, Fedora will use <a href="http://www.mulgara.org/">Mulgara</a> as its
        underlying triplestore, with full-text indexing disabled.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>REST API</strong> <br />
        The <a href="../server/webservices/rest/index.html">REST API</a> is a new, experimental feature which exposes a subset of
        the Fedora Access and Management APIs with a REST interface.</span></li>
        <li>
        <h3 id="installer.client">Client Install</h3>
        <span class="plaintext"> Both the quick and custom options will
        install the Fedora client software in addition to the Fedora server. The
        client option, however, will install only the Fedora client software. </span></li>
    </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
    <h2 id="running">Running the Fedora Server</h2>
    <span class="plaintext"> If you selected the quick install option,
    you will find Tomcat installed in FEDORA_HOME/tomcat. To run Fedora, start
    Tomcat by entering: <code class="block"> <pre>
$FEDORA_HOME/tomcat/bin/startup.sh
</pre> </code> <br />
    (or for Windows) <code class="block"> <pre>
%FEDORA_HOME%\tomcat\bin\startup.bat
</pre> </code> <br />
    If you selected the custom install option, ensure that your database server
    is running (unless you selected the embedded McKoi option) and start your
    servlet container if necessary. </span>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>
        <h3 id="running.demo">Demo Objects</h3>
        <span class="plaintext"> If you just started Fedora for the first
        time, it's a good idea to check out the demonstration objects to get an
        idea of how Fedora works. See <a href="demos.html">the Demo Manual</a>
        for complete descriptions of the demos. <br />
        <br />
        NOTE: If, during a custom install, you entered values other than the
        defaults for <em>fedoraServerHost</em> (localhost) or <em>fedoraServerPort</em>
        (8080), you must run the <em><strong>demo object converter
        utility</strong></em> script to change the host and/or port in the demo object ingest
        files. The demo object conversion is only required if you are ingesting
        demo objects. If the demo objects are already ingested into the
        repository (e.g. from a previous installation), there is no need for
        conversion. The demo objects are shipped with references to
        &quot;localhost:8080&quot; and these references must reflect the new
        values of <em>fedoraServerHost</em> <em>fedoraServerPort</em>. Refer to
        the <a href="../client/cmd-line/index.html">Command-line Utilities
        documentation</a> for additional details on running the demo object
        converter. <br />
        To ingest the demos, at a command prompt, enter: <code class="block">
        <pre>
fedora-ingest-demos [hostname] [port] [username] [password] [protocol]
</pre> </code> <br />
        For additional information on the fedora-ingest-demos command, see the
        documentation for the <a href="../client/cmd-line/index.html#indemo">
        client command-line utilities</a>. Please note that the demo objects must be
        ingested before they can be discovered using the default search
        interface. </span></li>
    </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
    <h2 id="database">Database</h2>
    <span class="plaintext"> Fedora is designed to be RDBMS-independent.
    Fedora has been tested with McKoi, MySQL, Oracle and PostgreSQL. The
    embedded version of McKoi included with the installer is provided as a
    convenience. Large repositories or repositories concerned with scalability
    and performance should consider using an alternative database. If you choose
    to use any database other than the embedded McKoi provided by the Fedora
    Installer, we assume here that the database is already installed. <br />
    <br />
    Follow the instructions below for the RDBMS of your choice in order to
    create the user and tables required by Fedora. </span>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>
        <h3 id="database.mysql">MySQL</h3>
        <span class="plaintext"> Please note that the MySQL JDBC driver
        provided by the installer requires MySQL v3.23.x or higher. <br />
        <br />
        The MySQL commands listed below can be run within the mysql program,
        which may be invoked as follows: <code class="block"> <pre>
mysql -u root -p
</pre> </code> <br />
        Create the database. For example, to create a database named fedora30,
        enter: <code class="block"> <pre>
CREATE DATABASE fedora30;
</pre> </code> <br />
        Set username, password and permissions for the database. For example, to
        set the permissions for user fedoraAdmin with password fedoraAdmin on
        database fedora30, enter: <code class="block"> <pre>
GRANT ALL ON fedora30.* TO fedoraAdmin@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'fedoraAdmin';
GRANT ALL ON fedora30.* to fedoraAdmin@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'fedoraAdmin';
</pre> </code> <br />
        MySQL 4.1.x users must also specify the default character set for the
        Fedora database as "utf8" and the default collation as "utf8_bin". For
        example, to set the default character set and collation on a database
        named "fedora30", enter: <code class="block"> <pre>
ALTER DATABASE fedora30 DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8;
ALTER DATABASE fedora30 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_bin;
</pre> </code> </span></li>
        <li>
        <h3 id="database.oracle">Oracle</h3>
        <span class="plaintext"> To prepare Oracle for use with Fedora,
        the following steps should be taken by an administrative user. <br />
        <br />
        First, using the Database Configuration Assistant, ensure that the
        database you'll be using is created with the UTF8 charset. <br />
        <br />
        Next, you'll need to create a Fedora tablespace and user in the
        database. Assuming the administrative user is sys and the SID is
        fedora30, log in using SQL*Plus using the following command: <code
            class="block"> <pre>
sqlplus sys/PASSWORD@fedora30 as sysdba
</pre> </code> <br />
        To create a tablespace named fedora_tblspace with data in
        /var/lib/oracle, enter the following: <code class="block"> <pre>
CREATE TABLESPACE fedora_tblspace
DATAFILE '/var/lib/oracle/fedora_tblspace.dat' SIZE 1024M REUSE
AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT 256M MAXSIZE UNLIMITED
SEGMENT SPACE MANAGEMENT AUTO;
</pre> </code> <br />
        To create a user fedoraAdmin with password fedoraAdmin, using the
        fedora_tblspace, enter the following: <code class="block"> <pre>
CREATE USER fedoraAdmin IDENTIFIED BY fedoraAdmin
DEFAULT TABLESPACE fedora_tblspace;
</pre> </code> <br />
        Using the GRANT command, make sure the user has permission to connect,
        create, alter, and drop tables sequences, triggers, and indexes in this
        tablespaces. For example, <code class="block"> <pre>
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES TO fedoraAdmin;
</pre> </code> <br />
        NOTE: Due to distribution license restrictions, the Fedora Installer
        does not include the Oracle JDBC driver. Oracle JDBC drivers are
        available from <a
            href="http://technet.oracle.com/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/content.html">http://technet.oracle.com/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/content.html</a>.
        The installer will prompt you for the location of the driver on your
        filesystem. </span></li>
        <li>
        <h3 id="database.postgresql">PostgreSQL</h3>
        <span class="plaintext"> Please consult the documentation at <a
            href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/</a>
        for more detailed information about configuring PostgreSQL. <br />
        <br />
        Launch the PostgreSQL interactive terminal, psql, (optionally appending
        the -U argument to connect as a different user). <code class="block">
        <pre>
psql -d postgres
</pre> </code> <br />
        To create a user fedoraAdmin with password fedoraAdmin and database
        named fedora30, enter the following: <code class="block"> <pre>
CREATE ROLE "fedoraAdmin" LOGIN PASSWORD 'fedoraAdmin';
CREATE DATABASE "fedora30" WITH ENCODING='UTF8' OWNER="fedoraAdmin";
</pre> </code> </span></li>
        <li>
        <h3 id="database.other">Other Databases</h3>
        <span class="plaintext"> To use a database other than McKoi,
        MySQL, Oracle or PostgreSQL, the database must support common SQL-92
        syntax and you must have a JDBC version 3 driver available. <br />
        <br />
        The JDBC driver will need to be installed manually. For most containers,
        the driver may be placed in the Fedora webapp's WEB-INF/lib directory.
        For Tomcat 5.0.x, however, the driver should be installed to
        TOMCAT_HOME/common/lib. The JDBC url will need to be configured
        appropriately in the Fedora Server Configuration File. <br />
        <br />
        Upon startup, Fedora checks the database for all required tables. If the
        tables do not exist, Fedora will them. Because table creation is much
        less standardized task across RDBMSs than SQL queries you must do one of
        the following: </span> <span class="plaintext">
        <ol>
            <li>Create the tables and indexes and auto-increments yourself

            in the source distribution for the RDBMS-neutral table
            specifications).</li>
            <br />
            <li>Write a subclass of fedora.utilities.DDLConverter for your
            database software, include it in the Fedora WEB-INF/classes
            directory or in a jar file in the Fedora WEB-INF/lib directory, and
            associate it with the JDBC driver inside the
            FEDORA_HOME/server/config/fedora.fcfg file (see how it's done by
            looking at the MySQLDDLConverter and McKoiDDLConverter associations
            with their respective drivers in the fedora.fcfg file, and the
            classes' implementations in the source distribution).</li>

    <h2 id="config">Configuring the Fedora Server</h2>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>
        <h3 id="config.fcfg">fedora.fcfg</h3>
        <span class="plaintext"> The Fedora Server's configuration is
        chiefly governed by the Fedora Server Configuration File (fedora.fcfg)
        located at FEDORA_HOME/server/config/fedora.fcfg. <br />
        <br />
        The Fedora server configuration file contains:<br />
        (1) global parameters for the Fedora server, (2) configuration
        parameters for each server module, and (3) configuration parameters for
        each persistent data store. <br />
        <br />
        The configuration file has a simple schema. It starts with a server
        element, under which a series of parameter elements occur, followed by a
        series of module elements, followed by a series of datastore elements.
        The parameter elements directly following the root server element are
        used to control what are considered generic server functionality; for
        example: the port on which the server is exposed. <br />
        <br />
        The module elements are used to configure specific parts of Fedora. For
        instance, the module with the role attribute,
        "fedora.server.search.FieldSearch" is used to configure the
        field-searching component of the server. Inside the module element,
        several param elements are included. These are specific to that module's
        implementation. Descriptions of each parameter can currently be found in
        the configuration file itself. <br />
        <br />
        The datastore elements are used to configure various databases that
        might be used by the system. Although the sample configuration file
        holds several, you will typically only need one. The datastore elements
        are associated with the modules by means of a parameter inside the
        associated module. In the sample configuration file, for example, the
        poolNames param of the fedora.server.storage.ConnectionPoolManager
        module refers to one of the datastore elements in its value. <br />
        <br />
        There are many other parameters you can configure with Fedora. Refer to
        the Fedora Server Configuration File itself (fedora.fcfg) for internal
        documentation on all the parameters. </span></li>

        <h3 id="config.log">Logging</h3>
        <span class="plaintext"> Fedora uses Log4J for logging. For
        detailed information about using Log4J, consult the Log4J Manual: <a
            href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/manual.html">http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/manual.html</a>.
        <br />
        <br />
        The log configuration file is located at
        FEDORA_HOME/server/config/log4j.properties. Changes to the logging
        configuration will not be reflected until Fedora is restarted. <br />
        <br />
        Normally, coarse-grained logs for Fedora are written to
        FEDORA_HOME/server/logs/fedora.log. The following examples show the
        kinds of configuration changes you can make to aid in debugging. <br />
        <br />
        To change the level to DEBUG for all Fedora classes, change the
        log4j.logger.fedora line to the following: <code class="block"> <pre>
log4j.logger.fedora = DEBUG, FEDORA
</pre> </code> <br />
        To change the level to DEBUG for just one class, add the following
        lines: <code class="block"> <pre>
log4j.logger.fedora.server.utilities.SQLUtility = DEBUG, FEDORA
log4j.additivity.fedora.server.utilities.SQLUtility = false
</pre> </code> <br />
        To change the level to DEBUG for a whole package, add the following
        lines: <code class="block"> <pre>
log4j.logger.fedora.server.resourceIndex = DEBUG, FEDORA
log4j.additivity.fedora.server.resourceIndex = false
</pre> </code> <br />
        To send all DEBUG messages for a package to STDERR, with methods and
        line numbers add the following lines: <code class="block"> <pre>
log4j.logger.fedora.server.security = DEBUG, SECURITY
log4j.additivity.fedora.server.security = false
log4j.appender.SECURITY = org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
log4j.appender.SECURITY.target = System.err
log4j.appender.SECURITY.layout = org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.SECURITY.layout.ConversionPattern = %p %d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t] (%c{1}.%M:%L) %m%n
</pre> </code> <br />
        To send all DEBUG messages for a package to a dedicated file, with
        methods and line numbers, add the following lines: <code class="block">
        <pre>
log4j.logger.fedora.server.security = DEBUG, SECURITY
log4j.additivity.fedora.server.security = false
log4j.appender.SECURITY = org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender
log4j.appender.SECURITY.File =
log4j.appender.SECURITY.MaxFileSize = 20MB
log4j.appender.SECURITY.MaxBackupIndex = 5
log4j.appender.SECURITY.layout = org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.SECURITY.layout.ConversionPattern = %p %d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t] (%c{1}.%M:%L) %m%n
</pre> </code> <br />
        Note: if log4j.appender.SECURITY.File is left empty, the file will be
        automatically created at FEDORA_HOME/server/logs/security.log </span></li>

    <h2 id="source">Installation from Source</h2>
    <span class="plaintext"> After unpacking the source distribution,
    change into the newly extracted directory. To build the installer, at a
    command prompt, enter: <code class="block"> <pre>
ant installer
</pre> </code> <br />
    Once the installer target has been run, you will be able to run the Fedora
    installer application. To start the installer, change to the
    FEDORA_HOME/dist directory and at a command prompt, enter: <code
        class="block"> <pre>
java -jar fedora-3.0b1-installer.jar
</pre> </code> <br />
    Please ensure that the user account that is running the installer has
    sufficient permissions to write to the directories where Fedora will be
    installed (if deploying to an existing Tomcat installation, this includes
    permissions to the Tomcat directory). For more information of the Installer,
    see the <a href="#installer">Installer</a> instructions in Section 2 of this
    document. <br />
    <br />
    To see a list of other build targets in the source distribution, at a
    command prompt, enter: <code class="block"> <pre>
ant -projecthelp
</pre> </code> </span></li>
