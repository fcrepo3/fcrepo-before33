      <p>There are multiple distribution packages in a release. The

            <p>If you're in Unix, you must change the permissions
            of the files in the server/bin directory so that you
            can execute them. For instance, if you installed in
            /usr/local, this can be done with the command

            is unpacked into C:\fedora-2.1b\server\, go to C:\ and
            unpack the client from there. It will go into
            C:\fedora-2.1b\client, so that now both the client and
            server are under one common directory.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>If the machine you're installing on doesn't have a

            example, C:\ or /usr/local. Then unpack the archive in
            that directory. It will create its own directory, named
            according to the version... like fedora-2.1b. This will

          <li>
            <p>PATH should contain the bin directory of Ant. If you

            before v1.6.2, you can use the version that comes with
            the Fedora source distribution in under
            %FEDORA_DEV%\res\apache-ant-1.6.2\bin (in Windows) or
            $FEDORA_DEV/res/apache-ant-1.6.2/bin (in Unix). IMPORTANT: If you
            use your own version of Ant, be sure it's v1.6.2+ or
            the build may not work. You can verify this by typing
            "ant -version" at the command prompt. Note: If you opt
            to use the ant binaries included with the source, and
            you're in Unix, be sure to change the permissions on
            the files in the bin directory so that you can execute
            ant. This can be done with the command: <span class=

      <p>Provided that you've followed all the appropriate

      <p>and everything necessary for a server and client
      distribution will be put in $FEDORA_DEV/dist</p>

      <p>If you want to run the server and client straight from
      where it was compiled, be sure to set your FEDORA_HOME to
      $FEDORA_DEV/dist, and add $FEDORA_HOME/server/bin and
      $FEDORA_HOME/client/bin to your PATH environment
      variable.</p>

      <p>For other targets, see the build.xml file or type ant
      -projecthelp for a brief description of each.</p>

      <p>To erase all temporary and compiled files created by a
      build, first ensure that your database and Fedora server are
      stopped, and type ant clean. If you're not using McKoi, you
      should also drop the fedora20 (or whatever you named it)
      database from your RDBMS if you want to start fresh.</p>

      <p>Fedora is designed to be RDBMS-independent, but comes with
      a pure java database called McKoi. It has been tested and
      works with McKoi, MySQL and Oracle 9i. If you choose to use
      any database but McKoi, we assume here that it is already
      installed.</p>

      <p>Follow the below instructions for the RDBMS of your choice

              <p><span class="emphasis"><em>mysql41_flag</em></span> is
              an optional paramter that is only used if you are running
              MySQL 4.1.x. If using MySQL 4.1.x Fedora requires that you 
              set the default character set to "utf8" and the default
              collation to "utf8_bin" for the Fedora database. Any value 
              may be used for this parameter. If present, the script will 
              automatically set the default character set to "utf8" and 
              the default collation to "utf8_bin" for the Fedora SQL 
              database. If you are running versions of MySQL prior to 4.1,
              OMIT THIS PARAMETER.</p>

        <p>Note: This command resolves to a batch file
        (mysql-config.bat) in Windows, and a shell script
        (mysql-config.sh) in Unix. These reside in the server's bin
        directory.</p>

        
      <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Important:</em></span> Fedora comes installed 
        with version 3.1.10 of the MySQL Connector/J JDBC driver that is compatible 
        with MySQL v3.23.x, 4.0.x, and 4.1.x. If you plan to use MySQL 4.1.x, 
        be sure to follow the note above referring to the mysql41_flag option 
        on the mysql-config database configuration script.</p>

        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Important:</em></span> If you
        are installing Fedora under Windows and plan to use an
        earlier version of MYSQL (e.g., 3.23.53 thru 3.23.58), you
        should use all lower case characters when specifiying the
        Fedora database name when running the mysql-config.bat
        script (e.g., "myfedoradb" instead of "MyFedoraDb").
        <!-- Additional information regarding the use of earlier
        versions of Windows MYSQL can be found at <a href=

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>With Oracle 9i, you will need to use an administrative
        account to manually create 1) the fedora user on the db,
        and 2) the tablespace on which that user has complete
        control.</p>

        <p>Then you'll need to make sure the Fedora server has the
        JDBC driver necessary to connect to the database. You can
        download the appropriate Oracle JDBC driver from <a href=
        "http://technet.oracle.com/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/content.html"
           target=
           "_top">http://technet.oracle.com/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/content.html</a>.
           This will come with a file called <span class=
           "emphasis"><em>ojdbc14.jar</em></span>. You will need to
           put that file on your Fedora server, in the directory:
           <span class=
           "emphasis"><em>FEDORA_HOME/server/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28/common/lib</em></span>.</p>

        <p>Then you should modify the
        FEDORA_HOME/server/config/fedora.fcfg file and ensure that
        the datastore entry (near the bottom) for Oracle points to
        the right host and database. The fedora.fcfg file that
        comes with the distribution uses a database on the local
        host called "fedora20".</p>

        <p>When you start fedora, be sure to use the parameter
        "oracle", as in <span class="emphasis"><em>fedora-start
        oracle</em></span>. Starting the server is more fully
        explained later.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>If you want to use a different database, it's an option,
        but it will take some extra work. Here's how it can be
        done:</p>

        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>The database needs to be JDBC-compliant and must
              support common SQL-92 syntax. The driver will need to
              be put in the server's jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28/common/lib directory
              so that Fedora picks it up, and the JDBC url will
              need to be configured appropriately in the server's
              config/fedora.fcfg file.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Upon startup, Fedora checks the database for all
        required tables. If they don't exist, it creates them.
        Creation of tables is a much less standardized task across
        RDBMSs than regular SQL queries. Thus, you must either</p>

        <div class="orderedlist">
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <p>create the tables and indexes and auto-increments
              yourself in your own database (see the file:
              src/dbspec/server/fedora/server/storage/resources/DefaultDOManager.dbspec
              in the source distribution for the RDBMS-neutral
              table specifications),</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>write your own subclass of
              fedora.utilities.DDLConverter for your database
              software, include it in a jar file in
              server/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28/common/lib, and associate it with the
              JDBC driver inside the server/config/fedora.fcfg file
              (see how it's done by looking at the
              MySQLDDLConverter and McKoiDDLConverter associations
              with their respective drivers in the fedora.fcfg
              file, and the classes' implementations in the source
              distribution).</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <p>If you choose option #2, please tell us about it, as it
        will be useful for other users of Fedora! Option 2 is
        harder, but it will make future installations of new
        versions of Fedora (where the db schema will likely change)
        much easier for you if you plan on using that database
        later.</p>

        </div>
      </div>

      
    <p>Beginning with Fedora 2.1b, the method of configuring the server has changed. 
      Before starting for the first time, you will want to select a base security 
      configuration and initialize the server with your base configuration using 
      the <i>fedora-setup</i> command-line utility. This process is described 
      in detail in the <i><a href="../server/securingrepo.html#CONFIG">Securing 
      Your Repository</a></i> document. Once fedora-setup has been run you can 
      then customize the generated configuration files as needed.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            
          <h4 class="title"><a name="d0e354" id=
            "d0e354"></a>fedora.fcfg Configuration File</h4>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>The configuration file has a simple schema. It starts
        with a server element, under which a series of param
        elements occur, followed by a series of module elements,
        followed by a series of datastore elements.</p>

        <p>The param elements directly following the root server
        element are used to control what are considered generic
        server functionality. Examples include the level of logging
        to do, the port on which the server should be exposed, and
        the superuser password.</p>

        <p>The module elements are used to configure specific parts
        of Fedora. For instance, the module with the role
        attribute, "fedora.server.search.FieldSearch" is used to
        configure the field-searching component of the server.
        Inside the module element, several param elements are
        included. These are specific to that module's
        implementation. Descriptions of each parameter can
        currently be found in the configuration file itself.
        Important ones will be listed below.</p>

        <p>The datastore elements are used to configure various
        databases that might be used by the system. Although the
        sample configuration file holds several, you will typically
        only need one. The datastore elements are associated with
        the modules by means of a parameter inside the associated
        module. In the sample configuration file, for example, the
        poolNames param of the
        fedora.server.storage.ConnectionPoolManager module refers
        to one of the datastore elements in it's value.</p>

      <p>You will probably want to change the values of the following parameters 
        for you own installation. Items in <span class="bold"><b>bold</b></span> 
        <span class=
        "emphasis"><em>must</em></span> be changed prior to running the server 
        for the first time. Other items may require changes depending on your 
        environment. For instance, object_store_base should be changed if you're 
        running the server in Unix, as the default value is windows-specific. 
        All configurable items are described in detail in the fedora.fcfg file. 
        Parameters that are new or that have changed since Fedora 2.0 are highligted

              PID actually exists in the object. This option provides a way to

              this should be a space-delimited list of pid namespaces that will 
              be accepted in the object as-is. By default, this list includes

      <p>Fedora is normally started with the command:</p>

      <p><span class="emphasis"><em>fedora-start</em></span></p>

      <p>The configuration file, fedora.fcfg, can be written so
      that it takes a parameter which has the effect of using an
      alternate value for some of the &lt;param...&gt; elements, if
      an alternate parameter exists. The default fedora.fcfg
      assumes that you're using MySQL, but has been written to use
      the mckoi database if you start it with:</p>

      <p><span class="emphasis"><em>fedora-start
      mckoi</em></span></p>

      <p>...so if you're using mckoi, start it with the above
      command instead.</p>

      <p>Read the fedora.fcfg file and look for the attributes
      named "mckoivalue" to see how this is done, if you're curious
      or would like to define your own parameter. You can also
      change the fedora.fcfg so that it doesn't have to take the
      "mckoi" parameter in order to run with mckoi (simply set the
      <span class="emphasis"><em>value</em></span> of the
      parameters to that of the <span class=
      "emphasis"><em>mckoivalue</em></span> attributes so that
      these values are taken by default.</p>

        or Port</h2>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>The Fedora server now has internal support for avoiding
    breakage of self-referential URLs (i.e., URLs that contain the
    hostname and port of the Fedora server itself). This change
    allows the Fedora server host and port to be re-configured
    without breaking digital objects that contained URLs that
    referred to a previous host and port configuration.</p>

    <p>The host name and port number on which the Fedora server
    runs is controlled by the <span class=
    "emphasis"><em>fedoraServerHost</em></span> and <span class=
    "emphasis"><em>fedoraServerPort</em></span> parameters in the
    fedora.fcfg configuration file. By default, these are set to
    the host name of <span class=
    "emphasis"><em>localhost</em></span> and port number of
    <span class="emphasis"><em>8080</em></span>. The steps you need
    to take in order to change host name and/or port number vary
    slightly depending on whether you are making the change for the
    first time or making the change on a pre-existing Fedora
    server.</p>

    <p>If you are installling Fedora for the first time and want to
    run using a host or port other than the defaults, you need to
    do the following:</p>

    <div class="itemizedlist">
      
    <ul type="disc">
      <li> 
        <p>Change the values of <span class=

    <p>If you have an existing Fedora server already running and

    <p>If you've just got your Fedora server up and running, it's a

    Demo Manual</a> for complete descriptions of the demos.</p>

    <p>The demos may be ingested via the Fedora Admin GUI tool or
    from the command line. If you ingest the from the Admin GUI,
    you must be sure to ingest bdef objects first, then bmech
    objects, then regular objects.</p>

    <p>To access the Admin GUI use the command:</p>

    <p><span class="emphasis"><em>fedora-admin [hostname] [port]
    [username] [password]</em></span></p>

    <p>To ingest the demos from the command line (recommended), use
    the command:</p>

    <p><span class="emphasis"><em>fedora-ingest-demos [hostname]
    [port] [username] [password]</em></span></p>

    <p>Please note that the demo objects must be ingested before
    they can be discovered using the default search interface.</p>
