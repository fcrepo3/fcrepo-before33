<h2><a name="d0e36">1. About This Manual</a></h2>
  <p>This manual describes the demonstration objects that are distributed with 
    the Fedora open-source repository software. These objects can be loaded into 
    the repository in one of two ways. The xml source files can be "ingested" 
    into the repository via the Fedora Admin GUI client (from the command prompt, 
    run: <code>fedora-admin</code>). Otherwise, they can be loaded with all other 
    demos by running the demo load script (from the command prompt, run: <code>fedora-ingest-demos 
    [hostname] [port] [username] [password] [protocol]</code>). The demo object 
    source xml files for the demo objects can be found in the following directory: 
    <strong>[FEDORA_HOME]/client/demo</strong>.</p>

<h3>There are two categories of demonstrations:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Server Demos</strong> - These demos can be run under 
            any conditions. They are intended to work when the Fedora repository 
            server is in a stand-alone condition, for example, if the repository 
            is running without a network connection, or if the repository is 
            behind a firewall and not set up to receive outside connections.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Open Server Demos</strong> - These demos can only be run if 
            the Fedora repository server is running as a network accessible 
            server, meaning that it can make outgoing connections AND accept 
            incoming connections.  If the repository server is running behind a 
            firewall, the firewall must be configured to allow incoming 
            connections on the port that the repository server is running. The 
            Open Server Demos use distributed content and services that are 
            remote to the repository server.
        </li>
    </ul>

<p>Once demo objects are ingested into the repository, they can be viewed via a 
web browser using API-A-LITE or API-A. Remember the URL syntax to get the object 
profile via API-A-LITE is : http://{hostname}:{port}/fedora/get/{objectPID}. For 
example: </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Simple Document Demo</b> - This Fedora data object (objectPID is 
            demo:18) demonstrates the simplest Fedora digital object scenario.  
            It is the case where we aggregate content in the Fedora object, and 
            let Fedora's default object behaviors provide access to the content.  
            This is an example of a Fedora digital object that has NO 
            DISSEMINATORS.  In this case, there are 3 datastreams in the object, 
            one for each format of a particular document (in this case the 
            recent Fedora paper presented at ECDL2002).  Since there are no 
            disseminators on the object, we can use the default Fedora object 
            behaviors (the "Default Disseminator" which is identifiable by the 
            behavior definition PID of "fedora-system:3").  The Default 
            Disseminator is dynamically associated with every object in the 
            repository.  Its behavior methods are on every object and include 
            the ability to list items in the object, get an item, get the 
            dissemination index, get Dublin Core record, and other information 
            about the object.  The results of these methods can be returned as 
            either HTML (method names begin with "view...") or XML (method names 
            begin with "get...").   The end result in that the object is simply 
            a container for content and metadata.  The user can view the 
            contents and get any item from the object.  While this scenario may 
            be easy to implement and useful, it does not take advantage of 
            Fedora's extensible behavior model where custom behaviors can be 
            associated with the object.
        </li>
        <li><b>Simple Image Demo</b> - The Fedora data object (objectPID is 
            demo:5) demonstrates the UVA Simple Image behaviors by associating a 
            simple disseminator with the object. There are 4 datastreams in the 
            object, one for each of four different image resolutions.  The 
            object has one disseminator that is subscribes to the "UVA Simple 
            Image" behavior definition and uses the Fedora HTTP Image Getter 
            service (behavior mechanism).  Four behavior methods are available 
            (getVeryHigh, getHigh, getMedium, and getThumbnail).  The 
            fulfillment of the behavior contract entails the Fedora HTTP Image 
            Getter resolving the URL of the appropriate datastream for each of 
            the UVA Simple Image behaviors.  There are no transformations 
            performed on the datastreams.  This object shows how a behavior 
            definition can be used to create a normalized set of methods for a 
            particular type of object, in this case image objects.  The idea 
            here, is that the Simple Image behavior definition provides a 
            standard set of dissemination methods that can be used on any image 
            object that subscribes to the Simple Image behavior definition.  As 
            we will see later, different variants of image objects can subscribe 
            to the same behavior definition, and is some cases the datastreams 
            will be dynamically transformed by a service to provide the 
            appropriate image disseminations.  This demo shows a simple 
            one-to-one mapping of the datastreams in the object to the behavior 
            methods.</li>
        <li><b>Document Transformation Demo</b> - The Fedora data object 
            (objectPID is demo:14) demonstrates the Document Transformation 
            behaviors.  There are 3 datastreams in the object, one XML source 
            document, and two XSLT stylesheets.  The object has one disseminator 
            that is associated with the "Document Transform" behavior definition 
            and the Fedora Local Saxon Service (behavior mechanism).  Two 
            behaviors are available (getDocumentStyle1 and getDocumentStyle2).  
            When these methods are run as disseminations, the repository 
            mediates access to the Fedora Local Saxon Service to produce the 
            appropriate transformation on the XML source in the object.  The 
            dissemination result will be one of two document styles. </li>
        <li><b><a name="imageCollection">Image Collection Demo</a></b> - 
            This demo illustrates the use of the Resource Index search service 
            to fulfill collection behaviors. <em>For this demo to work, the 
            <a href="../server/resourceIndex/index.html">Resource Index 
            module</a> must be enabled prior to ingesting these objects.</em>
            <p>A series of data objects (demo:SmileyBucket, demo:SmileyKeychain, 
            etc) subscribe to the image behaviors defined by the bDef object 
            demo:DualResImage.  Each of these image objects also use the 
            RELS-EXT datastream to assert its membership in the 
            demo:SmileyStuff collection.  The demo:SmileyStuff collection 
            subscribes to bDef object demo:Collection, which defines two 
            methods: list and view.  The collection object uses the 
            demo:DualResImageCollection bMech to implement those behaviors.</p>
            <p>To see the dynamic HTML listing of collection members in action, 
            you can view 
            http://hostname/fedora/get/demo:SmileyStuff/demo:Collection/view</p>
            <p>This dissemination first requests the list of members of the 
            demo:SmileyStuff collection using the local 
            <a href="../server/webservices/risearch/index.html">risearch 
            service</a>.  Then it uses the local <a href="../server/localservices/saxon/index.html">saxon service</a> to transform
            the XML results into a human-readable HTML page.  The query text and 
            the stylesheet are both datastreams of the SmileyStuff collection 
            and act as inputs to the list and view behaviors, respectively.</p>

    <h3><a name="d0e96"></a>B. Open Server Demos</h3>
    <p>These can be run in two ways.  The xml source files can be "ingested" 
       into the repository via the Fedora Admin GUI client (from the command 
       prompt, run: fedora-admin).  Otherwise, they can be loaded with all other 
       demos by running the demo load script (from the command prompt, run: 
       fedora-ingest-demos [hostname] [port] [username] [password]).</p>
       <ul>
           <li><b>Simple Image Demos</b> - These Fedora data objects (objectPIDs 
               are demo:6 and demo:7) demonstrate the UVA Simple Image behaviors 
               by associating more complex disseminators with the objects. They 
               also demonstrate how two objects with different kinds of 
               datastreams can be made to fulfill the UVA Simple Image behavior 
               contract.  The key thing to note here is that both the demo:6 and 
               demo:7 objects have a disseminator that subscribes to the UVA 
               Simple Image behavior definition.  However, they each use a 
               different service (behavior mechanism) to fulfill the behavior 
               contract.   In the case of demo:7, we have an object with 4 image 
               datastreams, one for each of four different image resolutions.  
               In this object the  UVA ImageZoomer service is used to add value 
               to the image datastreams at runtime.  When a behavior method is 
               run, the UVA ImageZoomer service will be called upon the wrap the 
               image in a Java applet that provides a standardized, zoomable 
               viewer for the images.  No matter which UVA Simple Image behavior 
               is run (getVeryHigh, getHigh, getMedium, getThumbnail), the 
               applet is provided.  In the case of demo:6, we have an object 
               with one image datastream, a wavelet-encoded MrSID file.  The 
               object has one disseminator that is subscribes to the "UVA Simple 
               Image" behavior definition and uses the UVA MrSID Service 
               (behavior mechanism).  Again, the same four behavior methods are 
               available (getVeryHigh, getHigh, getMedium, and getThumbnail).  
               This time, fulfillment of the behavior contract entails the use 
               of the MrSID service to derive the appropriate image resolution 
               out of the MrSID file.  Another notable feature of the demo:6 
               object is that it shows how XML metadata can be put in the object 
               as datastreams too.  The XML metadata datastreams can be viewed 
               via the Default Disseminator (run getItemIndex or viewItemIndex).  
               A final important point about these demos is that the behavior 
               mechanism services run remote from the repository.  Both the UVA 
               ImageZoomer service and the UVA MrSID Service run as web services 
               at University of Virginia.  These demonstrations show how Fedora 
               objects can leverage distributed web services, and most 
               importantly, now the Fedora repository system handles the 
               mediation and binding to these services in a manner that is 
               transparent to the user.
               <p>The Fedora data object (objectPID is demo:30) demonstrates the 
               UVA Simple Image behaviors by associating a simple disseminator 
               with the object.   There are 4 datastreams in the object, one for 
               each of four different image resolutions.  The object has one 
               disseminator that is subscribes to the "UVA Simple Image" 
               behavior definition and uses the Fedora HTTP Image Getter service 
               (behavior mechanism).  Four behavior methods are available 
               (getVeryHigh, getHigh, getMedium, and getThumbnail).  The 
               fulfillment of the behavior contract entails the Fedora HTTP 
               Image Getter resolving the URL of the appropriate datastream for 
               each of the UVA Simple Image behaviors.  There are no 
               transformations performed on the datastreams.  This object is 
               almost identical to the Fedora object (objectPID of demo:5) 
               created under the local-server-demos. The major distinction is 
               that the datastreams for this object are of type "R" indicating 
               that their external URLs are to be redirected by Fedora.  The 
               Fedora server typically protects the true location of external 
               datastreams by functioning as a proxy service, thereby not 
               exposing the physical datastream locations stored in the Fedora 
               objects. However, there are certain situations where users may 
               not want Fedora to proxy the location of external datastreams. 
               For example, streaming audio and video providers may provide 
               special optimization and performance tuning designed to function 
               with a direct connection between a web browser and the content 
               provider. Another example is datastreams that are protected by 
               HTTP Basic authentication. Fedora will provide its own 
               authentication and access policy in a future release to handle 
               access restrictions. In the interim, the redirected datastream 
               type can be used to access external datastreams that are 
               protected with Basic authentication. In the Fedora object in this  
               example, all 4 datastreams are protected on  the external web 
               server using HTTP Basic authentication which requires a username 
               and password in order to access the datastreams. When attempting 
               to execute the disseminations for these datastreams, you will be 
               prompted for a username and password. The required username and 
               password is "fedora". </p>
           </li>
           <li><b>Userinput Image Demos</b> - These Fedora data objects 
               (objectPIDs are demo:10 and demo:11) demonstrate the UVA 
               Userinput Image behaviors by associating a more complex 
               disseminator with the objects.  The UVA Userinput Image behavior 
               definition was constructed as a demonstration to show how a 
               behavior definition can allow for user input parameters at run 
               time.  In this case, the behavior definition has two methods 
               (getThumbnail and getImage).  The getImage method takes two user 
               input parameters:  the size of the image (e.g., small, medium1, 
               medium2) and whether to wrap the image in a zoomable applet (yes, 
               no).   Both objects share this behavior definition and both use 
               the same the UVA MrSID service.  Depending on what the user 
               enters, the MrSID Service will derive the proper size of the 
               image, and wrap it with a zoomable applet if the user requested.  
               The UVA MrSID Service runs as web services at University of 
               Virginia.  As with the Open Server Simple Image Demos, these 
               demonstrations show how Fedora object can leverage distributed 
               web services.
           </li>
           <li><b>EAD Finding Aid Demo</b> - This is the most elaborate of the 
               demonstration objects. This Fedora data object (objectPID is 
               demo:17) demonstrates the UVA Encoded Archival Description 
               (<a href="http://www.loc.gov/ead/">EAD</a>) Finding 
               Aid behaviors. It uses the Finding Aid behavior object (bDef 
               objectPID) and the Finding Aid mechanism object ( bMech objectPID 
               is demo:16). The behavior definition for a Finding Aid was 
               constructed to provide a real-life example of a complex 
               disseminator used with electronic texts. In this case, the 
               behavior definition consists of thirteen methods which provide 
               different views of a Finding Aid document.
       
               <ul>
                   <li>getTitlePage - displays the Title Page of the Finding Aid.</li>
                   <li>getAdminInfo - displays the Administrative Info section of the 
                   Finding Aid.</li>
                   <li>getSummaryInfo - displays the Summary section of the Finding 
                   Aid.</li>
                   <li>getBiogHistInfo - displays the Biographical and 
                       Historical section of the Finding Aid.</li>
                   <li>getScopeContentInfo - displays the Scope and Content 
                       Notes section of the Finding Aid.</li>
                   <li>getComponentInfo - displays the Components section of the 
                       Finding Aid.</li>
                   <li>getArrangeInfo - displays the Arrangement section of 
                       the Finding Aid.</li>
                   <li>getOrgInfo - displays the Organization section of the 
                       Finding Aid.</li>
                   <li>getEntireDoc - displays the entire Finding Aid document.</li>
                   <li>getMenu - displays a list of available behaviors for this 
                   Finding Aid.</li>
                   <li>viewFindingAid - displays the default preferred view of 
                       the Finding Aid.</li>
                   <li>getTitle - retrieve the title of the Finding Aid</li>
                   <li>searchFindingAid - perform a full-text search on this 
                       Finding Aid.</li>
               </ul>
          
          <p>The Finding Aid mechanism object provides the implementation of 
          these behaviors. Note in the mechanism object that the method bindings 
          point to external services that exist on one of the UVA web servers. 
          The majority of the methods are implemented as XSL stylesheets; 
          applying the appropriate stylesheet to the source document and 
          rendering the results in HTML-format. The preferred means of viewing 
          the Finding Aid is through the viewFindingAid method which provides a 
          special web-based presentation of the document consisting of three 
          html-frames. The top frame is generated by using the getTitle method 
          to extract the title of the document and form a banner. The left frame 
          is generated by calling the getMenu method which displays a list of 
          possible behaviors for this particular Finding Aid. The right frame, 
          displays the results of the specific dissemination; the default view 
          is to display the Title Page.</p>
          <p>In the sample object, you can 
          select one of the individual methods like getAdminInfo to see how each 
          method functions independently or you can select viewFindingAid to see 
          an example of how the methods have been neatly integrated into a 
          single presentation. For the viewFindingAid, method you will need to 
          supply the PID of this object which is demo:17. This is required since 
          the underlying mechanism is a generic one that can be applied to any 
          Finding Aid in the collection. We have pulled out this single object 
          from the collection to use as an example. You can perform a full-text 
          search on the Finding Aid by selecting the searchFindingAid method. 
          Here, you must supply the PID of the object (demo:17) and your search 
          query string.</p>
