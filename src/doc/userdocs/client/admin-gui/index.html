        <span class="plaintext">
          Fedora Administrator is the direct link to API-M functionality for repository administrators. Using this tool it is possible to ingest, search for and retrieve, modify and purge data objects and build, search for and retrieve, modify, and purge behavior objects (Behavior Definitions and Behavior Mechanisms).

        <h2 id="starting">Starting Fedora Administrator</h2>
        <span class="plaintext">
          navigate to the $FEDORA_HOME/client/bin directory
          <br />
          <br />
          fedora-admin [hostname] [port] [user] [pass]
          <br />
          <br />
          For example, <em>fedora-admin localhost 8080 fedoraAdmin fedoraAdmin</em> will start the GUI for a server running on the local machine, port 8080, where "fedoraAdmin"has been used both as the name and password of the server administrator.

          Added in the 2.1 release of Fedora is the authentication dialog. When you start Fedora Administrator, you will be asked to choose the server to which you wish to connect, the protocol you wish to use to connect to your Fedora repository (http or https), your username and password. The server and username fields are pre-populated and the password is validated using values from fedora.fcfg

        <h2 id="menus">Menus</h2>
        <span class="plaintext">
          Fedora Administrator has been designed with standard GUI based menus. The following menus are available in the Fedora Administrator window:
        </span>
          <ul>
            <li>Builders</li>
            <li>Window</li>
            <li>Help</li>
          </ul>

        <h2 id="filemenu">File Menu</h2>
        <span class="plaintext">
          <img src="images/menu-1.jpg" width="850" height="655" alt="file menu" />
          <br />
          <br />
          Commands on the file menu allow a repository administrator to perform operations on objects in the repository or to log in to a different repository.
        </span>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <h2 id="newobject">New Object</h2>
        <span class="plaintext">
          <img src="images/menu-3.jpg" width="850" height="655" alt="new object" />
          <br />
          <br />
          The <em>New</em> menu option allows users to build new Fedora objects from pre-existing component parts. When the <em>New...Data Object</em> option is selected a skeletal Fedora data object is ingested into the repository and the repository administrator/object owner then completes the object by defining a Behavior Definition and Behavior Mechanism for the object, adding datastreams, and finally binding disseminators and datastreams together.
          <br />
          <br />
          Users may also create behavior definition and behavior mechanism objects by selecting these submenu options. The complex task of building WSDL objects dictated the necessity of onscreen, context sensitive help screens for these builders. Clicking the <em>Help</em> button on any pane in the Behavior Definition Builder or Behavior Mechanism Builder will open a popup help screen defining each field in view.

  <div>
    <h4><a name="createobject" id="d0e119"></a>Creating a New Data
    Object</h4>
  </div>

  <p>This section provides instructions for building a new data
  object using Fedora Administrator.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>On the File Menu, select <em>New</em>.</p>

    <p>From the New submenu, select <em>Data Object</em>.</p>

    <p>The New Object Dialog appears.</p>

    <p><img border="0" src="images/newobj_dialog.jpg" width="403" height="180"></p>

    <p>Fill in the label data for the object and the identifier for a content model
    to which the data object subscribes. If a custom PID is
    desired, click the check box and fill in the PID value.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

    <p>Clicking <em>Create</em> causes a Fedora data object to be
    created and ingested into the repository. The new object is
    displayed in a tabbed pane showing the following tabs:
    <em>Properties, Datastreams, and Disseminators</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will 
	first be presented with the Object Properties pane.&nbsp; On this pane you 
	can add the following information:</p>
	<p><b>State:&nbsp; </b>The state of the object, defined as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>

    <p><em>Active</em>: the object is available to users conditional upon any 
	access control policy restrictions</p>
	<p><em>Inactive</em>: the object is only available to
    repository administrators.</p>

    <p><em>Deleted</em>: the object has been marked for permanent
    removal from the repository, pending review by repository
    administrators.</p>
  </blockquote>

  	<p><b>Label</b>:&nbsp; A description of the digital object</p>
	<p><b>Owner</b>:&nbsp; An identifier for the owner of the object</p>

	<img border="0" src="images/create-object-1.jpg" width="850" height="655"></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><b>View and Modify the Default Dublin Core Datastream</b></p>
	<p>Click on the <i>Datastreams</i> tab labeled as &quot;<b>DC</b>.&quot;&nbsp; The display will show a side tabbed pane displaying all
    datastreams currently in the object.&nbsp;&nbsp; When first created, all Fedora data objects
    will contain a default Dublin Core metadata datastream.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can 
	edit this metadata datastream, adding fields as
    appropriate for the data object in question.&nbsp; To add new Dublin Core 
	elements, edit the XML content for the datastream in the editing window.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	When done editing, click the Save Changes button on the bottom of the pane.</p>

    <p>
	<img border="0" src="images/create-object-dc.jpg" width="850" height="655"></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><b>Creating a New Datastream in the object</b></p>
	<p>To create a new datastream in the digital object, click on the side tab 
	labeled &quot;<b>New...</b>&quot;&nbsp; You are presented with a dialog window that 
	provides data input fields to enter all attributes for a datastream.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Enter the following information:</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><b>1.&nbsp; ID:</b>&nbsp; Enter a custom identifier for the datastream.&nbsp; 
	If left blank, the system will automatically assign a unique datastream id</p>
	<p><b>2.&nbsp; Control Group:</b>&nbsp; Clicking through the control group
    options will show text defining each control group option.&nbsp; The Control 
	Group lets you decide how you want the datastream content to be associated 
	with the digital object.&nbsp; Datastream content can be in-lined within the 
	object XML container file, it can be stored in the repository, or it can be 
	stored external to the repository (and digital objects point to the external 
	location).</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b><em>Internal XML Metadata</em></b>:&nbsp; In this case, the 
		datastream will be stored as XML that is actually stored inline within 
		the digital object XML file.&nbsp; The user may
    enter text directly into the editing window or data may
    imported from a file by clicking <em>Import</em> and selecting or browsing 
		to the location of the XML metadata file. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li><b><em>Managed Content</em></b>:&nbsp; In this case, the datastream 
		content will be stored in the Fedora repository and the digital object 
		XML file will store an internal identifier to that datastream.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		To get content,&nbsp; click <em>Import</em> and select or browse to the file location of
    the import file. Once import is complete, you will see the imported file in 
		a preview box on the screen.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li><em><b>External Referenced Content:</b>&nbsp; </em>In this case, the 
		datastream content will be stored outside of the Fedora repository, and 
		the digital object will store a URL to that datastream.&nbsp; The 
		datastream is &quot;by reference&quot; since it is not actually stored inside the 
		Fedora repository.&nbsp;&nbsp; While the datastream content is stored 
		outside of the Fedora repository, at runtime, when an access request for 
		this type of datastream is made, the Fedora repository will use this URL 
		to get the content from its remote location, and the Fedora repository 
		will mediate access to the content.&nbsp; This means that behind the 
		scenes, Fedora will grab the content and stream in out the the client 
		requesting the content as if it were served up directly by Fedora.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		This is a good way to create digital objects that point to distributed 
		content, but still have the repository in charge of serving it up.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		To create this type of datastream, specify the URL for the datastream 
		content in the Location URL text box.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li><b><em>Redirect</em>:</b> In this case, the datastream content is 
		also stored outside the repository and the digital object points to its 
		URL (&quot;by-reference&quot;).&nbsp;&nbsp; However, unlike the External 
		Referenced Content scenario, the Redirect scenario signals the 
		repository to redirect to the URL when access requests are made for this 
		datastream.&nbsp; This means that the datastream will not be streamed 
		through the Fedora repository when it is served up.&nbsp; This is 
		beneficial when you want a digital object to have a datastream that is 
		stored and served up by some external service, and you want the 
		repository to get out of the way when it comes time to serve the content 
		up.&nbsp; A good example is when you want a datastream to be content 
		that is stored and served by a streaming media server.&nbsp; In such a 
		case, you would want to pass control to the media server to actually 
		stream the content to a client (e.g., video streaming), rather than have 
		Fedora in the middle re-streaming the content out.&nbsp;&nbsp; To create 
		a Redirect datastream, specify the URL for the content in the Location 
		text box.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>3.&nbsp; State:</b>&nbsp; Set the state for the digital object as 
	Active, Inactive, or Deleted.&nbsp;&nbsp; The object states are defined as 
	follows:</p>

  <blockquote>

    <p><em>Active</em>: the datastream is available to users conditional upon 
	any access control policy restrictions</p>

    <p><em>Inactive</em>: the datastream is only available to
    repository administrators.</p>

    <p><em>Deleted</em>: the datastream has been marked for permanent
    removal from the repository, pending review by repository
    administrators.</p>
  </blockquote>

  	<p><b>4.&nbsp; Versionable: </b>&nbsp;You can decide on a 
	datastream-by-datastream basis whether the Fedora repository will version 
	the datastream when modification are made.&nbsp; By default all datastreams 
	are versioned, but you can override this with the Versionable drop down 
	settings.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you select &quot;Updates will create new version,&quot; a new 
	version of the datastream will be created when any change is made.&nbsp; All 
	previous versions of the datastream will be maintained.&nbsp; If you select 
	&quot;Updates will replace most recent version&quot; then any changes will overwrite 
	the most recent version of the datastream.&nbsp; In the &quot;replace&quot; case, if 
	there is already a previous version history of the datastream it will be 
	maintained (it will not be lost if you change to the &quot;replace&quot; option at 
	some point in the future after you have been versioning a datastream).&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
	<p><b>5.&nbsp; MIME Type:</b>&nbsp; Select the MIME type for the datastream 
	content.</p>
	<p><b>6.&nbsp; Label:</b>&nbsp; Give your datastream a descriptive label.&nbsp; </p>
	<p><b>7.&nbsp; Format URI: </b>&nbsp; Optionally, you can provide a format 
	identifier for the datastream.&nbsp;&nbsp; Examples of emerging format 
	identifier schemes found in
	<a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/default.htm">PRONOM</a> 
	and the <a href="http://hul.harvard.edu/gdfr/">Global Digital Format 
	Registry</a> (GDRF).</p>
	<p><b>8.&nbsp; Alternate IDs:</b>&nbsp; Optionally, you can assign one or 
	more alternate identifiers for you datastream.&nbsp; Such identifiers could 
	be local identifiers or global identifiers such as
	<a href="http://www.handle.net/">Handles</a> or <a href="http://doi.org/">
	DOI</a>.</p>
	<p><b>9.&nbsp; Checksum: </b>&nbsp; The Fedora repository has a global 
	setting for enabling datastream checksums to be calculated by the repository 
	when a datastream is created or modified.&nbsp;&nbsp; See the Fedora system 
	documentation of repository configuration for details.&nbsp; Also, refer to 
	the system documentation on Checksum Features for a complete discussion of 
	this functionality.&nbsp; A checksum is calculated on datastream content (it 
	does not include the various attributes of a datastream such as its 
	identifier, state, or mime type).&nbsp;&nbsp; In the datastream creation 
	dialog pane, you will see a drop down list where you can select a checksum 
	algorithm.&nbsp;&nbsp; This gives you some control for how you would like 
	the checksum handled for a particular datastream.&nbsp; (Or you can let the 
	default repository behavior take over.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The following can be 
	accomplished using the checksum data entry box:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If you select &quot;Default&quot; in the checksum drop down list, the 
		repository will handle everything based on how it is configured.&nbsp; 
		This means that if the repository is configured to automatically 
		checksum datastreams, it will use a default checksum algorithm 
		configured for the repository, it will calculate a checksum for the 
		datastream, and store it.</li>
		<li>If you select a particular checksum algorithm from the drop down 
		list box, you are essentially telling the repository that whatever it 
		has configured for datastream checksum, you wish to override that 
		behavior for this particular datastream.&nbsp; By specifying an 
		algorithm you are telling the repository to calculate a checksum for 
		that datastream using that algorithm that you specify.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
		<li>When you select a checksum algorithm from the drop down box, you 
		will notice that a text entry box appears next to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; You 
		can leave the box blank, and the repository will use the specified 
		algorithm and calculate a checksum values.&nbsp;&nbsp; You have another 
		option too, that is to provide the repository with a checksum value that 
		you have already calculated.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, the repository 
		service will still calculate a new checksum when it creates the 
		datastream, but if you provide a value from the client end, the 
		repository will use it as an integrity check to ensure that the client 
		and the server both agree on the checksum value for the datastream 
		content.&nbsp;&nbsp; The repository will calculate a checksum value, 
		using the algorithm you specify, and then it will compare its checksum 
		calculation with the checksum value you provided in the text box.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		If they match, that means that the datastream content was not altered in 
		the transmission from the client to the repository service.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		If they don't match, that indicates that something happened to the 
		datastream during the transaction, and the repository will throw an 
		exception.&nbsp; </li>
	</ul>
	<p>10.&nbsp; <b>What about the Datastream Content?</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Depending 
	on the datastream control group that you selected, the user interface will 
	present you with a different way to get the actual content for your 
	datastream.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
	<ul>
		<li>If you selected &quot;Internal XML Metadata&quot; you will see an editing 
		window at the bottom of the pane for creating XML content.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Alternatively, you can use the &quot;<b>Import</b>&quot; button to insert XML 
		content from a file.&nbsp; </li>
		<li>If you selected &quot;Managed Content&quot; you will see an &quot;<b>Import</b>&quot; 
		button on the bottom of the pane.&nbsp; Click this button to select a 
		file whose content will be pulled into the repository and stored as 
		managed datastream content.&nbsp;&nbsp; The digital object will have an 
		internal pointer to the repository stored content.</li>
		<li>If you selected &quot;External Referenced Content&quot; a new text entry box 
		labeled &quot;<b>Location</b>&quot; will appear where you are prompted to enter a 
		URL for content stored external to the repository.&nbsp; The digital 
		object will store this URL, and the content will NOT be copied into the 
		repository.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will remain &quot;by-reference.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		You will notice a &quot;View&quot; button appear at the bottom of the pane that 
		allows you to preview the content.&nbsp; </li>
		<li>If you selected &quot;Redirect&quot; you will also enter a URL in the &quot;<b>Location</b>&quot; 
		text entry box.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
	</ul>
	<p>When all information is supplies in the add Datastream pane, click the <b>
	Save Datastream</b> button.&nbsp;&nbsp; This will send an API-M request to 
	the Fedora repository service to add the new Datastream to the digital 
	object.&nbsp;&nbsp; A completed Datastream pane is depicted below.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><img border="0" src="images/create-ds-1.jpg" width="850" height="655"></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><b>Adding a Disseminator to an object</b></p>

    <p>Optionally, you can add a disseminator to the digital object to provide 
	dynamic view of datastream content.&nbsp;&nbsp; A disseminator essentially 
	associates a service definition with the object, with information about 
	which datastreams in the object should be used as input to the service to 
	produce dynamic views.&nbsp;&nbsp; The basic idea of a disseminator is 
	discussed elsewhere, particularly in <a href="../../tutorials/tutorial2.pdf">
	Tutorial 2</a> found in the system documentation.</p>
	<p>To create a disseminator, click the Disseminator tab to bring that pane to the front.&nbsp; 
	On this tab, you can provide a descriptive label for the disseminator.&nbsp; 
	Your main tasks will be to select a pre-existing service definition (a 
	Behavior Definition Object) and a pre-existing service implementation (a 
	Behavior Mechanism Object).&nbsp;&nbsp; As described in Tutorial 2, these 
	are special control objects that your repository administrator will have 
	already ingested into your Fedora repository (or you can ingest them too.)&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	The task of creating a disseminator is to know what kinds of services you 
	have on hand, and what kinds of objects (they are compatible with).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	By creating a disseminator, you don't actually store the behavior 
	definitions or mechanisms with the digital object.&nbsp; You just point to 
	the control objects in the repository that contain metadata that describes 
	the service and how to bind to the service.&nbsp; Once these relationships 
	between your digital object and the control objects are established (via the 
	disseminator), then the repository can use the information found in the 
	control objects at run time to provide dynamic views of the digital object.</p>

    <p>First, select the type of Behavior Definition (service) you want to 
	associate with the object using the drop down list box:</p>

    <p><img border="0" src="images/create-diss-1.jpg" width="850" height="655"></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Once the Behavior Definition has been selected, the pane
    will display a list of specific behavior methods that are defined by the Behavior Definition, and the Behavior Mechanism
    drop down menu will appear.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Behavior Mechanism drop 
	down prompts you to select a particular implementation of the service that 
	is defined by the Behavior Definition object you selected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	The idea here is that the same set of abstract behaviors (abstract service 
	definition) may have been implemented by one or more service providers.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	If there are multiple implementations, you choose which one you want to have 
	associated with this digital object.&nbsp; </p>

    <p>Select a Behavior Mechanism from the drop down menu as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp; The values in the menu are pre-populated based on the
    Behavior Definition chosen in the previous step. Once the
    Behavior Mechanism is selected, the Bindings tabs are shown for
    each method required by that Behavior Definition/Behavior
    Mechanism pairing.</p>

    <p><img border="0" src="images/create-diss-2.jpg" width="850" height="655"></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The final step is to specify which datastreams in your object can be used 
	as input to the Behavior Mechanism (service implementation).&nbsp; To do 
	this look at the tabs that appear next the the words &quot;Bindings&quot; on the 
	bottom area of the pane.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each tab represents an input 
	requirement for the selected Behavior Mechanism.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the example 
	above, we have selected a Behavior Mechanism that allows simple image 
	behaviors and the mechanism wants you to tell it which datastream in your 
	object fulfill the roles of different image resolutions.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
	assumption in this example is that you created an object that has a 
	datastream for each of four image resolutions (low, medium, high, very 
	high).&nbsp;&nbsp; One by one, click the binding tabs.&nbsp; There will be a 
	message that tells you the kinds of datastreams that can be used (in terms 
	of their MIME types).&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the &quot;Add...&quot;&nbsp; button to the 
	right to select a particular datastream from your digital object to fulfull 
	the role of the mechanism binding.&nbsp; A pop up dialog box will appear 
	listing all datastreams that meet the MIME Type requirement for that tab as 
	seen below.</p>
	<p><img border="0" src="images/create-diss-3.jpg" width="394" height="152"></p>
	<p>Click the drop down list to see all possible datastreams that can be 
	bound.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK when you find an appropriate datastream.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	At this point you will be returned to the Disseminator creation pane and you 
	will see that the selected datastream has been associated with a particular 
	binding for the Behavior Mechanism that will perform image services.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	In this example, the datastream that we created earlier (the Flying Fox in 
	Sydney JPEG) is now associated with a binding known as &quot;HIGHRES_IMG)&nbsp; 
	Continue to click through the other binding tabs to associate a datastream 
	with each binding that the Behavior Mechanism specifies.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><em>The Datastreams Pane</em></p>

  <p>On the Datastreams Pane, the state of each datastream in the
  object can be modified, along with the datastream label and
  location. The MIME type of the datastream is shown, along with the control 
	group, info type, create date, and the Fedora URL of the object</p>
	<blockquote>
    <p><b>Datastream States</b></p>

    <p><em>Active</em>: the datastream is freely available to all
    users.</p>

    <p><em>Inactive</em>: the datastream is only available to
    repository administrators.</p>

    <p><em>Deleted</em>: the datastream has been marked for
    permanent removal from the repository, pending review by
    repository administrators.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>From this pane, users may additionally request to view a
  datastream, add a new datastream to the object, export a
  datastream's contents, or purge the datastream from the
  object.&nbsp; </p>

  <p><i><b>Editing Datastream Content</b></i>:&nbsp; If a datastream has a <em>text</em> MIME type (e.g.,
  <em>text/xml</em>, it may be edited in place by clicking the
  <em>Edit</em> button and making the desired changes in the editing window. or to export the data
  contained in the datastream by clicking the <em>Export</em>
  button.&nbsp; If the datastream is not linked to an active disseminator, it 
	may be purged from the object.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only datastreams with a <em>text</em> MIME type may be edited 
	directing from the Datastream pane. Datastreams with other MIME types (e.g., <em>image</em> or
  <em>application</em>, e.g., <em>image/jpeg</em> or
  <em>application/pdf</em> may only be viewed, exported, or purged
  from the object.</p>

  <p><b><i>I</i><em>mport</em></b>: Choose this button to import new data by

  file name and location to which to write the XML file of the datastream content.</p>

  <p><em><b>Purge: </b>&nbsp;</em>Choose this button to remove a datastream from 
	the object.&nbsp; You will be warned that the
  operation is permanent and must click "Yes" to continue.&nbsp;&nbsp; If "Yes"
  is selected, the datastream is immediately purged from the
  object.&nbsp; Purge is not valid for the DC metadata datastream because it is always
  linked to the default disseminator.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Please note that datastreams which are linked to active

  </div>

  <p>When selecting to ingest objects from the File menu, users
  have the option of ingesting a single object or multiple
  objects.</p>

  <p>Objects may be ingested from a file or from another
  repository.</p>

  <div>

  </div>

  <p>
	<img border="0" src="images/ingest-one-object.jpg" width="850" height="655"></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><b>Ingest From File:</b>&nbsp; Choosing Ingest One Object from File, the user is prompted to
  select the file name from a dialog box or browse to the location
  of the file on the local drive(s) for the file to be ingested.
  Clicking <em>Open</em> will cause the file to be ingested. If the
  repository has been set to retain PIDs on ingest in fedora.fcfg,
  the PID in the object XML will be maintained. Otherwise, the PID
  will be overwritten.</p>

  <p>
	<img border="0" src="images/ingest-file-dialog.jpg" width="508" height="360"></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><b>Ingest From Repository:</b>&nbsp; Choosing Ingest One Object from Repository causes the Source
  Repository dialog box to appear. The user must fill in the
  hostname: port of the source repository, the protocol (http or https) and enter a username and
  password. Clicking <em>OK</em> initiates the Input dialog, where
  the user is prompted for a PID value. Clicking <em>OK</em> on the
  Input dialog completes the object ingestion.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <div>
    <h4><a name="d0e450" id="d0e450"></a>Ingest Objects by Type</h4>
  </div>

  <p>Users may also ingest all the files in a directory or all the
  files of a specific object type in a repository by selecting the
  Ingest Objects by Type submenu item.&nbsp; There are three basic types of 
	objects in Fedora:&nbsp; Data Objects (your regular objects that you 
	create), Behavior Definition Objects (control objects that store a service 
	definition), and Behavior Mechanism Objects (control objects that store 
	service binding metadata such as WSDL).&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

  <p><b>Ingest From Directory:&nbsp; </b>Upon selecting Ingest Objects By Type from File, a dialog box
  prompts the user to select or browse to the directory containing
  the objects to be selected. Once the directory has been
  identified, clicking <em>Open</em> will activate a second dialog
  box which prompts the user to select the type of object to be
  ingested behavior definition, behavior mechanism, and/or data
  object.</p>

  <p><img border="0" src="images/selectbytype.jpg" width="187" height="170"></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>It should be noted that if you have created control objects (Behavior 
	Definition and Mechanism objects), any regular Data Objects that depend on 
	them should be ingested <i>after</i> the control objects are ingested.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	You don't want to try to ingest Data Objects with dependencies on control 
	objects that don't exist.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, If you select all three types 
	of objects together,&nbsp; Fedora will ensure that the control objects get 
	ingested first.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are ingesting one kind of object at a 
	time, Behavior Definition Objects should be ingested before Behavior 
	Mechanism objects that depend on them.&nbsp; Then, Data Objects can be 
	ingested that depend on the Behavior Definition/Mechanism objects. </p>

  <p>If the repository has been configured to &quot;retain PIDs&quot; on ingest (see the 
	Fedora repository configuration documentation), then whatever PID is found 
	in the ingest XML file (also known as the Submission Information Package or 
	SIP) is what the repository accepts as the PID for the new ingested digital 
	object.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the &quot;retain PIDs&quot; option is not enabled for the 
	repository, the ingest function will automatically assign a new PID to the 
	digital object, and ignore whatever PID was in the ingest XML file.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><b>Ingest From Repository:&nbsp; </b>Choosing Ingest Objects by Type from Repository causes the
  Source Repository dialog box to appear. The user must fill in the
  hostname: port of the source repository, and enter a username and
  password. Clicking <em>OK</em> causes the Select Object Type
  dialog to appear. Selecting the types of objects to be ingested
  from the source repository--behavior definitions, behavior
  mechanisms, or data objects--and clicking <em>OK</em> initiates
  ingestion of <b>all</b> objects of that type from the source
  repository.</p>

  <p>During ingest, the status bar at the bottom of the Fedora
  Administrator window shows the activities of the server. Once
  ingest is complete, a summary pane will appear giving counts of
  objects successfully ingested, objects failed, and time elapsed.
  Click <em>OK</em> to clear this message. The View Ingest Log
  dialog will then open. The user may click <em>Yes</em> and view
  the detailed log file or <em>No</em> to view the file at a later
  time. The log file is created in the $FEDORA_HOME/client/logs/
  directory.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>

  <div>
    <h3><a name="export" id="d0e510"></a>Export Object</h3>
  </div>

  <p>Users have the option of exporting a single object or
  exporting objects by type.&nbsp; This functionality can be used from the 
	File/Export menu.&nbsp; </p>
	<p><img border="0" src="images/export-menu.jpg" width="850" height="655"></p>

  <div>
    <h4><a name="d0e515" id="d0e515"></a>Export One Object</h4>
  </div>

  <p><img border="0" src="images/exportdirdialog.jpg" width="508" height="360"></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>When the Export One Object option is selected, the user is
  prompted to select a directory to which the export file will be
  written. Clicking <em>Open</em> causes the user to be prompted
  for an object PID.&nbsp; The PID will be used as the basis for the export file 
	(named like <em>[pid].xml)</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the export is done, you 
	must first provide a few more pieces of information.&nbsp; First, you must 
	choose the export serialization format, either FOXML or METS (the Fedora 
	extension of METS).&nbsp;&nbsp; Next you must provide the &quot;export context&quot; 
	which will create an appropriate export file for the context in which you 
	plan to use it.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are three export context types to choose 
	from:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Migrate</b>:&nbsp; an export file will be create that is 
		appropriate for migrating into another Fedora repository.&nbsp; This 
		means that any references to the repository's base URL (with its host 
		and port) will be virtualized, so that if the export object is 
		subsequently ingested into another Fedora repository, the object will 
		inherit the base URL of the new repository.&nbsp; The result is that 
		repository-referential assertions in the exported digital object will 
		naturally adapt to the new repository environment. </li>
		<li><b>Public Access</b>:&nbsp; an export file will be created that is 
		appropriate for facilitating public access and re-use of the digital 
		object.&nbsp; All datastream locations will be resolvable URLs, most 
		notably, the Managed Content datastreams will contain public callback 
		URLs to the repository from which the object was exported.&nbsp; The 
		assumption is that the repository will still exist, and that the 
		original object will continue to be served up by the repository (so the 
		callback URLs continue to work).&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
		<li><b>Archive</b>:&nbsp; an export file will be created with all 
		managed content contained within it.&nbsp; This means that all Managed 
		Content datastreams will have the datastream content Base64-encoded 
		within the digital object export file.&nbsp; For Referenced and 
		Redirected datastreams, their by-reference URLs will be in the export 
		file (meaning that the repository will not pull the external content 
		into the export file, but keep it by-reference).&nbsp;&nbsp; For 
		datastreams that were of type &quot;Inlined XML&quot; the XML will remain in-lined 
		as it normally is the the digital object XML file. </li>
	</ul>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

  <div>
    <h4><a name="d0e532" id="d0e532"></a>Export Object by Type</h4>
  </div>

  <p>When the Export Object by Type option is selected, the user is
  prompted to select a directory to which the export files will be
  written. Clicking <em>Open</em> causes the user to be prompted
  for which type of object is to be exported--behavior definitions,
  behavior mechanisms, or data objects. The default selection is
  data objects. When the file types are selected and <em>OK</em> is
  clicked, the system searches for and retrieves <b>all</b> objects
  of that type, which are then exported to individual files in the
  destination directory. The files are named
  <em>pidvalue.xml</em>.</p>

  <div>

  </div>

  <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1049" src="images/input.jpg" border="0" height="121" width="293"/></p>

  <p>Purging an object completely and permanently removes it from
  the repository. Upon selecting the Purge option, the user will be
  prompted to enter an object PID and a reason for the object's
  removal. Please note that objects with dependencies in the
  repository cannot be purged. <b>WARNING: There is no "Are you
  sure" dialog with this option.</b></p>

  <div>

  </div>

  <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1050" src="images/input.jpg" border="0" height="121" width="293"/></p>

  <p>This menu option allows a user to view the xml, but not edit.
  XML may be cut and pasted into another application using standard
  keyboard commands of the host operating system, (e.g. CTL-C,
  CTL-V in Windows) if desired.</p>

  <div>

  </div>

  <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1051" src="images/login.jpg" border="0" height="184" width="279"/></p>

  <p>The Change Repository option allows a repository administrator
  to login to a different Fedora repository. When selected, this
  menu option causes the Login dialog to be displayed. The
  repository administrator may then select a different Fedora
  server with which to connect, entering the appropriate login name
  and password.</p>

  <div>
    <h3><a name="exit" id="d0e582"></a>Exit</h3>
  </div>

  <p>The Exit menu option closes all connections with the Fedora

    <h2><a name="toolsmenu" id="d0e587"></a>Tools Menu</h2>
  </div>

  <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1052" src="images/tools_menu.jpg" border="0" height="308" width="400"/></p>

  <p>Commands on the Tools menu provide the user with the ability
  to search and retrieve objects from the repository, build and
  ingest batches of digital objects, and under the console submenu,
  gain access directly to API-M and API-A methods for testing
  purposes.</p>

  <div>
    <h3><a name="search" id="d0e595"></a>Search/Browse
    Repository</h3>
  </div>

  <p>The Search/Browse Repository menu option provides a mechanism
  for searching and retrieving objects from the Fedora repository.
  Upon ingestion, metadata from the Fedora System Metadata section
  and the Dublin Core (DC) Metadata section of the object are
  indexed in a relational database, and may be searched using this
  menu option. The DC Metadata section is an optional
  Implementer-Defined XML Metadata datastream in the object, where
  the <em>Datastream ID</em> is DC, and the XML conforms to the
  schema at <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd" target="_top">http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd</a>. If a
  Dublin Core metadata datastream is not provided, Fedora will
  construct a minimal DC datastream consisting of the elements
  dc:title and dc:identifier. The value for dc:title will be
  obtained from the object's label (if present in the object) and
  the value for dc:identifier will be assigned to the object's
  persistent identifier or PID.</p>

  <p>The search interface provides both simple and advanced
  searching. All queries are case insensitive. Simple Search
  enables queries of words and phrases occurring anywhere in than
  object's indexed metadata fields. Advanced Search enables fielded
  searching across any combination of metadata elements using
  string comparison operators (&nbsp; = and ~&nbsp;) for string
  fields, and value comparison operators (&nbsp; =, &gt;, ≥, &lt;, ≤ &nbsp;) for date fields (dc:date fields may be treated as
  both). The wildcards, * and ? may be used in any string-based
  query.</p>

  <div>
    <h4><a name="d0e608" id="d0e608"></a>Simple Search Tab</h4>
  </div>

  <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1053" src="images/simplesearch.jpg" border="0" height="314" width="400"/></p>

  <p>The Simple Search tab is the default selection in the Search
  Repository window. The Simple Search query searches both the
  Dublin Core metadata and the Fedora System Metadata fields.</p>

  <p>At the top of the Search window, the user may select fields to
  be displayed by clicking the <em>Change</em> button and
  selecting/deselecting field names from the dialog.</p>

  <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1054" src="images/searchfieldsdialog.jpg" border="0" height="239" width="298"/></p>

  <p>The Simple Search searches all indexed metadata fields for the
  text entered into the text box. All searches are case
  insensitive. The wildcard character '*'; can be substituted for
  any string of characters. The wildcard character '?'; can be
  substituted for any single character. Clicking <em>Search</em>
  will retrieve a list of objects where the entered text string
  appears in an indexed metadata field.</p>

  <div>
    <h4><a name="d0e629" id="d0e629"></a>Advanced Search Tab</h4>
  </div>

  <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1055" src="images/searchadvanced.jpg" border="0" height="314" width="400"/></p>

  <p>The Advanced Search query enables users to refine their
  repository search by searching specific fields for specific
  values provided in the query.</p>

  <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1056" src="images/srch_adv_cond_dialog.jpg" border="0" height="110" width="416"/></p>

  <p>The search conditions can be modified by clicking the
  <em>Add</em> button, which opens the Enter Condition dialog. The
  user selects the field to be defined from the drop down menu,
  selects the condition to be matched, and enters the text to be
  matched, if appropriate. Clicking <em>OK</em> saves the
  condition. Once all conditions are entered, clicking
  <em>Search</em> will retrieve a list of objects in which all
  conditions are met.</p>

  <div>
    <h4><a name="d0e651" id="d0e651"></a>Search Results Window</h4>
  </div>

  <p>The Search Results Window displays the results of a successful
  search in a table format. Across the top of the table are a row
  of labels of the fields that have been returned from the objects
  meeting the search criteria. Double clicking anywhere on a row
  opens that object. Right clicking anywhere on a row opens a
  pop-up menu that contains object level tasks from which the user
  may select. These tasks include <em>Open Object</em>, <em>View
  Object XML</em>, <em>Export ...</em>, <em>Purge</em>, and <em>Set
  Object State To</em>. If <em>Set Object State To</em> is
  selected, a submenu will provide the user with valid states from
  which to select.</p>

  <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1057" src="images/searchpopupmenu.jpg" border="0" height="308" width="400"/></p>

  <p>The <em>Purge</em> and <em>Set Object State To</em> submenu
  options can be used on multiple objects by using mouse clicks or
  the equivalent keyboard commands to multiselect rows in the
  Search Results Window. In this way, groups of objects can be
  purged from the system, or have their states changed by means of
  one search and retrieval operation.</p>

  <div>
    <h3><a name="d0e685" id="d0e685"></a>Batch Processing</h3>
  </div>

  <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1058" src="images/tools_batch.jpg" border="0" height="314" width="400"/></p>

  <p>The Batch menu item includes tools to create and ingest
  multiple Fedora objects, which are FOXML documents or
  Fedora-specific METS documents contained in files outside the
  repository. The Batch Modify tool is also included here and
  allows users to modify batches of already-ingested Fedora
  objects.</p>

  <h4>Batch Ingest</h4>

  <p>It's simple to ingest objects created by one-up edit or by
  custom scripting.</p>

  
<p>The Batch menu also supports building objects. This takes a general template 
  common to all objects in a batch and makes object-specific substitutions into 
  the template. The template can be either a Fedora METS XML document or a Fedora 
  FOXML document and contains data common to the objects of the batch. Separate 
  XML documents hold the per-object substitution values. The format of the template 
  (FOXML or METS) determines the format of the built objects.</p>

  <p>The relatedness of objects in a batch is defined by what
  Fedora Administrator allows to be substituted and by which
  substitutions you choose to make. Data from the template are
  retained, unless replaced per individual object, including XML
  comments.</p>

  <p>Fedora Administrator provides for three modes of object batch
  processing: <b>batch build</b>, <b>batch ingest</b>, and a
  combined <b>batch build and ingest</b>.</p>

  
<p>This phased processing is shown in the following diagram.</p>

  <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1059" src="images/table.jpg" border="0" height="253" width="583"/></p>

    <p>Select <em>Tools</em> on the Fedora Administrator menu bar,
    and select item <em>Build and Ingest Batch</em>.</p>

    
  <p>This will open a <em>Batch Build</em> and Ingest window. You may need to 
    adjust this window's size to see its controls. Use the <em>browse</em> buttons 
    to enter the four required settings. Clicking on a <em>browse</em> button 
    opens a standard directory/file selection dialog.</p>

    <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1064" src="images/build-ingest.jpg" border="0" height="319" width="400"/></p>

    
  <p>Then click the <em>Build and Ingest this batch</em> button to build the batch 
    of Fedora METS XML documents and then ingest them into Fedora. The format 
    of the built objects is determined by the format of the template.</p>

   <p>A confirmation dialog will open requesting confirmation of the object template selected. Clicking <em>Yes</em> will continue the batch build. Clicking <em>No</em> or <em>Cancel</em> will return the user to the <em>Batch Build and Ingest</em> window.</p>

    <p><img alt="" src="images/templatecheck.jpg" border="0" height="98" width="416"/></p>


    <p>A second (<em>output-only</em>) window will open to show progress. You can 
    build and ingest multiple different batches before closing the <em>Batch Build 
    and Ingest</em> window.</p>

    <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1065" src="images/build-ingest-output.jpg" border="0" height="399" width="400"/></p>

    <p>There is then no need to separately ingest the created
    batch.</p>

    <p>No subdirectories or files are deleted by Fedora
    Administrator. Setup and cleanup of the files in the batch must
    be done by you using standard operating systems facilities.</p>

    <p>Fedora Administrator does not itself validate on <em>Batch
    Build</em>, but batch ingest into Fedora does. The batch fails
    on the first individual object ingest failure.</p>

    
  <p>Fedora will not ingest a <i>METS</i> file whose <b>METS:xmldata</b> elements

    <h4><a name="d0e1201" id="d0e1201"></a>Object-Specifics</h4>
  </div>

  
<p><em>Object-specifics</em> are coded in XML files. These data include: object 
  ID, label, and comment; datastream and object metadata and accompanying label; 
  datastream URLs, titles, and labels. Prior to Fedora 2.1, there was no formal 
  <i>batchMerge</i> schema for object-specific files and the schema was implied 
  based on the example object-specific files. The new <i>batchMerge.xsd</i> schema 
  provides a more formal definition that conforms to the pre-Fedora 2.1 object-specific 
  examples and also provides some new extensions for attributes introduced with 
  <i>FOXML</i>. The new schema can be found at: <a href="http://www.fedora.info/definitions/1/0/api/batchMerge.xsd"> 
  http://www.fedora.info/definitions/1/0/api/batchMerge.xsd</a>. </p>
<p>Where possible, attribute names on elements are the same as in the Fedora <i>METS</i> 
  or <i>FOXML</i> schema, and so correspond to like-named attributes in the Fedora 
  <i>METS</i> or <i>FOXML</i> template. How these map is described below and by 
  running the demo and viewing the results for one of the objects.</p>

  
<p>Any individual substitution is optional. When absent as a substitution, the 
  value in the template will be used for the resulting Fedora <i>METS</i> or <i>FOXML</i> 
  object. (Demo template and <em>object-specific</em> contents are chosen instructively 
  to highlight substitutions made.) Datastream URLs will generally be specific 
  to an object; practice will show which other substitutions are generally made.</p>

  
<p>All <i>non-METS</i> and <i>non-FOXML</i> namespaces used in your own metadata 
  must be declared, as in <b>xmlns:uvalibadmin</b> in the demo.</p>

  
<p>The <i>metadata</i> element is for backward compatibility with pre-Fedora 2.1 
  <i>object-specific</i> file formats where inline XML metadata was treated separately 
  from other types of datastreams. It is recommended that users use the new extended 
  <i>datastream</i> element for all types of datastreams. The <i>metadata</i> 
  element may be deprecated in a future release of the batchMerge schema. </p>
<p>When working with a <i>METS</i> template object:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Datastream IDs here map to those found in the Fedora <b>METS:fileGrp</b> 
    element (the nested, not the nesting, one). The associated <b>xlink:href</b> 
    and <b>xlink:title</b> attributes are substituted into the Fedora <b>METS:Flocat</b> 
    element, which is nested within that Fedora <b>METS:fileGrp</b> element.</p>
  <p>Datastream labels substitute instead into <b>METS:structMap.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When working with a <i>FOXML</i> template object:.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Datastream IDs here map to the <b>ID</b> attribute found in the Fedora <b>foxml:datastream 
    </b>element. The associated <b>xlink:href</b> attribute maps to the <b>REF</b> 
    attribute found in the Fedora <b>foxml:contentLocation</b> element. The <b>xlink:title</b> 
    attribute is for backward compatibility. Both datastream <b>LABEL</b> and 
    <b>xlink:title</b> attributes map to the <b>LABEL</b> attribute found in the 
    Fedora <b>foxml:datastreamVersion</b> element. It is recommended that you 
    use the <b>LABEL</b> attribute instead of the <b>xlink:title</b> attribute 
    when referring to the label of a datastream.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Case matters in attribute and element names.</p>

  
<p>Fedora will retain as PIDs only <b>OBJIDs</b> whose prefixes are included in 
  the fedora.fcfg file retainPids parameter (e.g., test, demo, etc.). Other <b>OBJIDs</b> 
  will be replaced by Fedora-generated PIDs.</p>

  <p><em>object-specs</em> in a given batch should meet the
  structural requirements of that batch's template: same number and
  tagging of datastreams, same number and tagging of metadata
  elements. Since substitutions are optional, individual
  <em>object-specs</em> cannot have "missing" data: the resulting
  object simply retains the template's value. Neither can
  <em>object-specs</em> have "extra" data: the resulting object
  simply lacks the <em>object-spec's</em> data -- because the
  template isn't designed to use it. In either case, the batch goes
  on.</p>

  
<p>The following <em>object-spec</em> fragment from <i>americanacademy.xml</i> 
  illustrates some of this.</p>

<div>
    <h4><a name="d0e1289" id="d0e1289"></a>Progress Report
    File</h4>
  </div>

  <p>Fedora Administrator already provides a progress report of
  each use of a batch tool, written to a GUI window, to provide
  user feedback. Additionally, this progress report is now written
  to a text file, to provide a permanent record.</p>

  <p>[Note that this progress report is not especially suited and
  is not intended for further processing by another computer
  program. Use the "object processing map", a different output file
  already provided, for such machine processing.]</p>

  <p>The progress report file is written to the same directory as
  the object processing map. The name of any instance of these new
  files includes the time when it is written, e.g.,
  20031203-123201-365.txt [The final group of numerals would serve
  to differentiate report files written, oddly but possibly, at the
  same second, by 2 instances of the GUI client running on the same
  machine.]</p>

  <p>The following description tells what is recorded in this new
  file and how its directory is chosen in giving the location of
  the object processing map.</p>

  <p>The batch tools are available through the Tools menu, under
  Batch, and serve to provide: Build Batch, Build and Ingest Batch,
  or Ingest Batch.</p>

  <p>After selecting one of these tools, a dialog box opens for
  user input of tool parameters. This dialog box is titled "Batch
  Build", "Batch Build and Ingest", or "Batch Ingest", depending on
  which tool is chosen. For each tool, one of the required
  parameters is the path to the "object processing map" (an output
  file), which records the tool's processing in a form amendable to
  later input to another program. This path is specified in a usual
  file dialog, including its parent directory.</p>

  <p>This is the parent directory, also, into which the new
  processing report file is written.</p>

  <p>The contents of this new file is simply the contents of the
  respective output window of the GUI client, one of : "Batch Build
  Output", "Batch Build and Ingest Output", or "Batch Ingest
  Output".</p>

  <h3>Batch Modify</h3>

  <p>The Batch Modify Utility is an application that enables the
  modification of objects in batch mode. It is designed for use by
  repository administrators and is available under the Tools menu
  of the Administrator GUI client. It can also be invoked as a
  command-line utility using either the fedora-modify.bat (Windowx)
  or fedora-modify.sh (unix) scripts located in the distribution
  client/bin directory.</p>

  <p>The basic design of the utility is to process an xml input
  file containing modify directives and then process each directive
  in sequence using the methods of API-M. The format of the
  directives file is specified by an xml schema name
  batchModify.xsd. The schema is available in the local
  distribution in the tomcat ROOT webapp and is also available from
  the Fedora website at <a href="http://www.fedora.info/definitions/1/0/api/batchModify.xsd">http://www.fedora.info/definitions/1/0/api/batchModify.xsd</a>.
  Each modify directive mirrors the capability of the corresponding
  API-M directives.</p>

  <h4>Process Directives</h4>

  <p>The Batch Modify Utility is accessed through the Tools menu of
  the Administrator GUI client under the submenu heading of
  Batch/Modify Batch.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/image002.jpg" border="0" height="382" width="532"/></p>

  <p>The Modify Batch menu contains two sub-items named Process
  Directives and Validate Directives File. The Process Directives
  menu item is used to begin processing a valid set of xml
  directives in a modify directives file. The Validate Directives
  File item is used to parse an existing batch modify directives
  file to insure that it conforms to the Fedora Batch Modify XML
  schema.</p>

  <p>Selecting the Process Directives item will prompt for the
  location of the directives file.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/image003.jpg" border="0" height="506" width="707"/></p>

  <p>After selecting a directives file, you will be asked to
  confirm the choice.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/image004.jpg" border="0" height="114" width="568"/></p>

  <p>Upon clicking the yes button, the directives file will be
  processed and a log file generated that details the number of
  directives processed and any errors that may have occurred.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/image005.jpg" border="0" height="154" width="315"/></p>

  <p>If there were any errors, you can peruse the log file to
  ascertain more information about what caused the directive to
  fail.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/image006.jpg" border="0" height="151" width="513"/></p>

  <p>The log file consists of an xml file containing entries for
  each directive that was processed.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/image008.jpg" border="0" height="487" width="624"/></p>

  <h4>Validate Directives</h4>

  <p>The Validate Directives menu item is used to verify that an
  existing directives file is valid before attempting to process
  the file. This can be useful when the directive files were
  created using a non-xml editor that was unable to validate the
  file as it was created. The steps for validating a directive file
  are similar to that for processing. First you are prompted for
  the location of the directives file to be processed.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/image009.jpg" border="0" height="446" width="624"/></p>

  <p>Confirming the file location initiates the parsing process and
  the results are displayed when parsing is completed.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/image010.jpg" border="0" height="115" width="568"/></p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/image011.jpg" border="0" height="153" width="558"/></p>

  <h4>To Demo</h4>

  <p>There is a sample batch modify directives file included in the
  distribution located in the dist/client/demo/batch-demo directory
  named modify-batch-directives.xml. This sample file creates a new
  object and then performs various additions, deletions, and
  modifications to the object's components through s series of
  directives. For reference the the sample directives file is
  included below.</p>

  <h4>Using Command Line with Modify Batch</h4>

  <p>The Modify Batch utility can also be run from the command line
  using the fedora-modify.bat (Windows) or the fedora-modify.sh
  (unix) scripts. These are located in the distribution in the
  dist/client/bin directory. Arguments for these scripts mirror
  those required in the interactive GUI interface.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <div>
      fedora-modify.bat
    </div>

    <div>
      fedora-modify.sh&lt;&lt;/div&gt;
    </div>
  </blockquote>

  <div>
    <p>Usage: fedora-modify? host port username password
    directives-filepath log-filepath validate-only-option</p>

    <p>Where</p>
  </div>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>host</strong> Fedora server host</li>

    <li><strong>port</strong> Fedora server port</li>

    <li><strong>username</strong> Fedora admin username</li>

    <li><strong>password</strong> Fedora admin password</li>

    <li><strong>directives-filepath</strong> filepath of the modify
    directives file</li>

    <li><strong>log-filepath</strong> filepath for the log
    filevValidate-only-option Boolean toggle determining whether to
    validate only ( true validate only, false process
    directives)</li>
  </ul>

      <h3><a name="d0e1308" id="d0e1308"></a>Console</h3>
    </div>

    <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1066" src="images/tools_console.jpg" border="0" height="308" width="400"/></p>

    <p>The options under the Console submenu give developers direct
    access to the methods in the Fedora APIs and to the
    Stdout/Stderr window. In this way, development tools calling
    API methods can be more efficiently tested.</p>

    <p>These console windows are not intended for casual users or
    repository administrators, therefore they contain no guiding
    text to assist users in their function. Developers should
    carefully read the Fedora Technical Specification to understand
    the parameters required for each method in the Fedora APIs.</p>

    <div>
      <h2><a name="d0e1318" id="d0e1318"></a>Builders</h2>
    </div>

    <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1067" src="images/builders_menu.jpg" border="0" height="298" width="400"/></p>

    <p>The Builders submenu gives users access to the Behavior
    Definition Builder and the Behavior Definition Builder. These
    WSDL objects are of such complex structure that it was
    necessary to create a wizard-like tool to enable users to
    construct custom Behavior Definitions and Behavior
    Mechanisms.</p>

    <p>The complexity of the task requires that extensive help be
    available within the Fedora Administrator interface, so on
    every pane of these builders, users will find a Help button.
    Clicking this button, opens a help screen that guides the user
    through the data on that pane.</p>

    <div>
      <h2><a name="d0e1328" id="d0e1328"></a>Window Menu</h2>
    </div>

    <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1068" src="images/window_menu.jpg" border="0" height="298" width="400"/></p>

    <p>The Window menu contains standard commands for managing
    multiple panes open in the Fedora Administrator window. These
    include:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Cascade</p>

      <p>Tile</p>

      <p>Minimize All</p>

      <p>Restore All</p>
    </blockquote>

    <div>
      <h2><a name="d0e1349" id="d0e1349"></a>Help Menu</h2>
    </div>

    <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1069" src="images/help_menu.jpg" border="0" height="308" width="400"/></p>

    <p>The help menu has two options:</p>

    <p>Documentation: which gives users the URL to the online
    documentation for Fedora.</p>

    <p>About Fedora Administrator: which provides version
    information, and copyright and licensing notices.</p>
