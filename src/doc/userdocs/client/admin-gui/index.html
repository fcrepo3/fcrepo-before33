  <p>Fedora Administrator is the direct link to API-M functionality
  for repository administrators. Using this tool it is possible to
  ingest, search for and retrieve, modify and purge data objects
  and build, search for and retrieve, modify, and purge behavior
  objects (Behavior Definitions and Behavior Mechanisms).</p>

  <div>
    <h2><a name="d0e54" id="d0e54"></a>Starting Fedora
    Administrator</h2>
  </div>

  <p>navigate to the $FEDORA_HOME/client/bin directory</p>

  <p>fedora-admin [hostname] [port] [user] [pass]</p>

  <p>For example, <em>fedora-admin localhost 8080 fedoraAdmin
  fedoraAdmin</em> will start the GUI for a server running on the
  local machine, port 8080, where "fedoraAdmin"has been used both
  as the name and password of the server administrator.</p>

  <p><img id="_x0000_i1027" src="images/login.jpg" alt="_x0000_i1027" border="0" height="184" width="279"></p>

  <p>Added in the 2.1b release of Fedora is the authentication
  dialog. When you start Fedora Administrator, you will be asked to
  choose the server to which you wish to connect, the protocol you wish to use to connect to your Fedora repository (http or https), your username and password. The server and username fields are pre-populated and
  the password is validated using values from <span class="SpellE">fedora.fcfg</span></p>

  <div>
    <h2><a name="d0e71" id="d0e71"></a>Menus</h2>
  </div>

  <p>Fedora Administrator has been designed with standard GUI based
  menus. The following menus are available in the Fedora
  Administrator window:</p>

  <p>Builders</p>

  <p>Window</p>

  <p>Help</p>

  <div>
    <h2><a name="d0e92" id="d0e92"></a>File Menu</h2>
  </div>

  <p><img id="_x0000_i1028" src="images/file_menu.jpg" alt="_x0000_i1028" border="0" height="308" width="400"></p>

  <p>Commands on the file menu allow a repository administrator to
  perform operations on objects in the repository or to log in to a
  different repository.</p>

  <div>
    <h3><a name="d0e100" id="d0e100"></a>New</h3>
  </div>

  <p><img id="_x0000_i1029" src="images/filenew.jpg" alt="_x0000_i1029" border="0" height="308" width="400"></p>

  <p>The <em>New</em> menu option allows users to build new Fedora
  objects from pre-existing component parts. When the
  <em>New...Data Object</em> option is selected a skeletal Fedora
  data object is ingested into the repository and the repository
  administrator/object owner then completes the object by defining
  a Behavior Definition and Behavior Mechanism for the object,
  adding datastreams, and finally binding disseminators and
  datastreams together.</p>

  <p>Users may also create behavior definition and behavior
  mechanism objects by selecting these submenu options. The complex
  task of building WSDL objects dictated the necessity of onscreen,
  context sensitive help screens for these builders. Clicking the
  <em>Help</em> button on any pane in the Behavior Definition
  Builder or Behavior Mechanism Builder will open a popup help
  screen defining each field in view.</p>

  <div>
    <h4><a name="d0e119" id="d0e119"></a>Creating a New Data
    Object</h4>
  </div>

  <p>This section provides instructions for building a new data
  object using Fedora Administrator.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>On the File Menu, select <em>New</em>.</p>

    <p>From the New submenu, select <em>Data Object</em>.</p>

    <p>The New Object Dialog appears.</p>

    <p><img id="_x0000_i1030" src="images/newobj_dialog.jpg" alt="_x0000_i1030" border="0" height="173" width="403"></p>

    <p>Fill in the label data for the object and the content model
    to which the data object subscribes. If a custom PID is
    desired, click the check box and fill in the PID value.</p>

    <p>Clicking <em>Create</em> causes a Fedora data object to be
    created and ingested into the repository. The new object is
    displayed in a tabbed pane showing the following tabs:
    <em>Properties, Datastreams, and Disseminators</em>.</p>

    <p>Click the Disseminator tab to bring that pane to the front.
    On this tab, the user must</p>

    <p>Fill in the Disseminator Label</p>

    <p>Select a Behavior Definition from the drop down menu</p>

    <p><img id="_x0000_i1031" src="images/newbdefdrop.jpg" alt="_x0000_i1031" border="0" height="308" width="400"></p>

    <p>Once the Behavior Definition has been selected, the pane
    will display a list of methods available for and parameters
    required by the Behavior Definition, and the Behavior Mechanism
    drop down menu will appear.</p>

    <p>Select a Behavior Mechanism from the drop down menu</p>

    <p><img id="_x0000_i1032" src="images/newbmech.jpg" alt="_x0000_i1032" border="0" height="308" width="400"></p>

    <p>The values in the menu are pre-populated based on the
    Behavior Definition chosen in the previous step. Once the
    Behavior Mechanism is selected, the Bindings tabs are shown for
    each method required by that Behavior Definition/Behavior
    Mechanism pairing.</p>

    <p><img id="_x0000_i1033" src="images/newbmech2.jpg" alt="_x0000_i1033" border="0" height="308" width="400"></p>

    <p>Click on the <em>Datastreams</em> tab</p>

    <p>The display will show a side tabbed pane displaying all
    datastreams currently in the object. All Fedora data objects
    contain a Dublin Core metadata datastream after ingest. The
    user will wish to edit this metadata, adding fields as
    appropriate for the data object in question.</p>

    <p><img id="_x0000_i1034" src="images/newdcmeta.jpg" alt="_x0000_i1034" border="0" height="308" width="400"></p>

    <p>Click on the <em>New</em> side tab</p>

    <p>Fill in the label for the datastream, select the MIME
    type</p>

    <p><img id="_x0000_i1035" src="images/newmimedialog.jpg" alt="_x0000_i1035" border="0" height="308" width="400"></p>

    <p>Select the Control Group. Clicking through the control group
    options will show text defining each control group option.</p>

    <p>If the datastream is <em>Internal XML Metadata</em>, select
    the classification from the drop down menu (descriptive,
    digital provenance, source, rights, or technical). The user may
    enter text directly into the editing window or data may
    imported from a file by clicking <em>Import</em> and selecting
    or browsing to the location of the XML metadata file. Click
    <em>Save</em> to save the datastream to the object.</p>

    <p>If the datastream is <em>Managed Content</em>, click
    <em>Import</em> and select or browse to the file location of
    the import file. Once import is complete, click <em>Save</em>
    to save the datastream to the object.</p>

    <p>If the datastream is <em>External Referenced Content</em>,
    fill in the Location URL and click <em>Save</em> to save the
    datastream to the object.</p>

    <p>If the datastream is <em>Redirect</em>, specify the redirect
    URL in the Location text box and click <em>Save</em> to save
    the datastream to the object.</p>

    <p>Once all datastreams required have been created and saved,
    you must bind the disseminators and datastreams together.</p>

    <p>Click on the <em>Disseminators</em> tab</p>

    <p>For each Binding required by the Behavior
    Definition/Behavior Mechanism Contract, the user must select a
    datastream.</p>

    <p>Click on the Binding tab to be defined. Click the
    <em>Add</em> button.</p>

    <p><img id="_x0000_i1036" src="images/newaddbind.jpg" alt="_x0000_i1036" border="0" height="308" width="400"></p>

    <p>From the New Binding dialog, select the datastream from the
    drop down menu which matches the Binding to be completed. Click
    <em>OK</em>.</p>

    <p><img id="_x0000_i1037" src="images/newmapds.jpg" alt="_x0000_i1037" border="0" height="145" width="471"></p>

    <p>Repeat for each binding/datastream pair. When all Bindings
    are complete, the <em>Save Disseminator</em> button will be
    active. Click to save the Disseminator. Your new object is now
    complete.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <div>
    <h3><a name="d0e271" id="d0e271"></a>Open</h3>
  </div>

  <p><img id="_x0000_i1038" src="images/input.jpg" alt="_x0000_i1038" border="0" height="121" width="293"></p>

  <p>The <em>Open</em> menu requires input of an object PID for
  retrieval of the object. Upon retrieval, the object is displayed
  on two tabbed panes.</p>

  <p><em>Object Properties Pane</em></p>

  <p>The default first pane is the Object Properties pane. On this
  pane the state and label of the object may be modified. Creation
  and modification dates are shown, along with the content model to
  which the object subscribes and the owner of the object.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Object States</b></p>

    <p><em>Active</em>: the object is freely available to all
    users.</p>

    <p><em>Inactive</em>: the object is only available to
    repository administrators.</p>

    <p><em>Deleted</em>: the object has been marked for permanent
    removal from the repository, pending review by repository
    administrators.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Also available on this pane is the ability to view the
  object's XML, export the object to a file, or purge the object
  from the repository.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Viewing XML</b>: From this window, the XML of the object
    can be viewed, but cannot be modified.</p>

    <p><b>Export Object</b>: If Export is selected, the user will
    be prompted for a file name and location to which to write the
    XML file. The format for exported objects is fedora:mets.</p>

    <p><b>Purge Object</b>: Purging an object completely removes it
    from the repository. Upon selecting the Purge option, the user
    will be prompted to enter a reason for the object's removal.
    Please note that objects with dependencies in the repository
    cannot be purged. <b>WARNING: There is no "Are you sure" dialog
    with this option and the purge cannot be undone</b>.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><em>The Datastreams Pane</em></p>

  <p>On the Datastreams Pane, the state of each datastream in the
  object can be modified, along with the datastream label and
  location. The MIME type of the datastream is shown, along with
  the control group, info type, create date, and the Fedora URL of
  the object.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Datastream States</b></p>

    <p><em>Active</em>: the datastream is freely available to all
    users.</p>

    <p><em>Inactive</em>: the datastream is only available to
    repository administrators.</p>

    <p><em>Deleted</em>: the datastream has been marked for
    permanent removal from the repository, pending review by
    repository administrators.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>From this pane, users may additionally request to view a
  datastream, add a new datastream to the object, export a
  datastream's contents, or purge the datastream from the
  object.</p>

  <p>Please note that datastreams which are linked to active
  disseminators may not be purged.</p>

  <p>If a datastream has a <em>text</em> MIME type (e.g.,
  <em>text/xml</em>, it may be edited in place by clicking the
  <em>Edit</em> button and making the desired changes in the
  editing window. A user may also choose to import new data by
  clicking the <em>Import</em> button or to export the data
  contained in the datastream by clicking the <em>Export</em>
  button. If the datastream is not linked to an active
  disseminator, it may be purged from the object. Note: Purge is
  not valid for the DC metadata datastream because it is always
  linked to the default disseminator.</p>

  <p>If <em>Import</em> is selected, the user is prompted for a
  file name or url where the the import file is located.</p>

  <p>If <em>Export</em> is selected, the user is prompted for a
  file name and location to which to write the XML file of the
  datastream content.</p>

  <p>If <em>Purge</em> is selected, the user is warned that the
  operation is permanent and must click "Yes" to continue. If "Yes"
  is selected, the datastream is immediately purged from the
  object.</p>

  <p>Only datastreams with a <em>text</em> MIME type may be edited.
  Datastreams with other MIME types (e.g., <em>image</em> or
  <em>application</em>, e.g., <em>image/jpeg</em> or
  <em>application/pdf</em> may only be viewed, exported, or purged
  from the object.</p>

  <div>
    <h3><a name="d0e418" id="d0e418"></a>Ingest</h3>
  </div>

  <p>When selecting to ingest objects from the File menu, users
  have the option of ingesting a single object or multiple
  objects.</p>

  <p>Objects may be ingested from a file or from another
  repository.</p>

  <div>
    <h4><a name="d0e425" id="d0e425"></a>One Object</h4>
  </div>

  <p><img id="_x0000_i1039" src="images/fileingestdirdialog.jpg" alt="_x0000_i1039" border="0" height="278" width="400"></p>

  <p>Choosing Ingest One Object from File, the user is prompted to
  select the file name from a dialog box or browse to the location
  of the file on the local drive(s) for the file to be ingested.
  Clicking <em>Open</em> will cause the file to be ingested. If the
  repository has been set to retain PIDs on ingest in fedora.fcfg,
  the PID in the object XML will be maintained. Otherwise, the PID
  will be overwritten.</p>

  <p><img id="_x0000_i1040" src="images/ingest_repo.jpg" alt="_x0000_i1040" border="0" height="169" width="267"></p>

  <p>Choosing Ingest One Object from Repository causes the Source
  Repository dialog box to appear. The user must fill in the
  hostname: port of the source repository, the protocol (http or https) and enter a username and
  password. Clicking <em>OK</em> initiates the Input dialog, where
  the user is prompted for a PID value. Clicking <em>OK</em> on the
  Input dialog completes the object ingestion.</p>

  <p><img id="_x0000_i1041" src="images/input.jpg" alt="_x0000_i1041" border="0" height="121" width="293"></p>

  <div>
    <h4><a name="d0e450" id="d0e450"></a>Objects by Type</h4>
  </div>

  <p><img id="_x0000_i1042" src="images/fileingestdirdialog.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="278" width="400"></p>

  <p>Users may also ingest all the files in a directory or all the
  files of a specific object type in a repository by selecting the
  Ingest Objects by Type submenu item.</p>

  <p>Upon selecting Ingest Objects By Type from File, a dialog box
  prompts the user to select or browse to the directory containing
  the objects to be selected. Once the directory has been
  identified, clicking <em>Open</em> will activate a second dialog
  box which prompts the user to select the type of object to be
  ingested behavior definition, behavior mechanism, and/or data
  object.</p>

  <p><img id="_x0000_i1043" src="images/selectbytype.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="163" width="187"></p>

  <p>If you choose to separate your objects by type into separate
  directories for ingestion, please remember that the behavior
  objects to which a data object are bound must exist in the
  repository before the data object can be ingested. Order of
  ingestion must be</p>

  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li style="">Behavior Definition</li>

    <li style="">Behavior Mechanism</li>

    <li style="">Data Object</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Using the Ingest Objects by Type from File submenu allows
  users to place all objects in a single directory, and the Fedora
  software will ingest the objects in that directory in the proper
  order.</p>

  <p>If the repository has been set to retain PIDs on ingest in
  fedora.fcfg, the PID in the object XML will be maintained.
  Otherwise, the PID will be overwritten.</p>

  <p><img id="_x0000_i1044" src="images/ingest_repo.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="169" width="267"></p>

  <p>Choosing Ingest Objects by Type from Repository causes the
  Source Repository dialog box to appear. The user must fill in the
  hostname: port of the source repository, and enter a username and
  password. Clicking <em>OK</em> causes the Select Object Type
  dialog to appear. Selecting the types of objects to be ingested
  from the source repository--behavior definitions, behavior
  mechanisms, or data objects--and clicking <em>OK</em> initiates
  ingestion of <b>all</b> objects of that type from the source
  repository.</p>

  <p><img id="_x0000_i1045" src="images/selectbytype.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="163" width="187"></p>

  <p>During ingest, the status bar at the bottom of the Fedora
  Administrator window shows the activities of the server. Once
  ingest is complete, a summary pane will appear giving counts of
  objects successfully ingested, objects failed, and time elapsed.
  Click <em>OK</em> to clear this message. The View Ingest Log
  dialog will then open. The user may click <em>Yes</em> and view
  the detailed log file or <em>No</em> to view the file at a later
  time. The log file is created in the $FEDORA_HOME/client/logs/
  directory.</p>

  <div>
    <h3><a name="d0e510" id="d0e510"></a>Export</h3>
  </div>

  <p>Users have the option of exporting a single object or
  exporting objects by type.</p>

  <div>
    <h4><a name="d0e515" id="d0e515"></a>One Object</h4>
  </div>

  <p><img id="_x0000_i1046" src="images/exportdirdialog.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="278" width="400"></p>

  <p>When the Export One Object option is selected, the user is
  prompted to select a directory to which the export file will be
  written. Clicking <em>Open</em> causes the user to be prompted
  for an object PID and when <em>OK</em> is clicked, the file is
  exported to the selected directory. The file is named
  <em>pidvalue.xml</em>.</p>

  <div>
    <h4><a name="d0e532" id="d0e532"></a>Export Object by Type</h4>
  </div>

  <p><img id="_x0000_i1047" src="images/exportdirdialog.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="278" width="400"></p>

  <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1048" src="images/selectbytype.jpg" border="0" height="163" width="187"></p>

  <p>When the Export Object by Type option is selected, the user is
  prompted to select a directory to which the export files will be
  written. Clicking <em>Open</em> causes the user to be prompted
  for which type of object is to be exported--behavior definitions,
  behavior mechanisms, or data objects. The default selection is
  data objects. When the file types are selected and <em>OK</em> is
  clicked, the system searches for and retrieves <b>all</b> objects
  of that type, which are then exported to individual files in the
  destination directory. The files are named
  <em>pidvalue.xml</em>.</p>

  <div>
    <h3><a name="d0e555" id="d0e555"></a>Purge Object</h3>
  </div>

  <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1049" src="images/input.jpg" border="0" height="121" width="293"></p>

  <p>Purging an object completely and permanently removes it from
  the repository. Upon selecting the Purge option, the user will be
  prompted to enter an object PID and a reason for the object's
  removal. Please note that objects with dependencies in the
  repository cannot be purged. <b>WARNING: There is no "Are you
  sure" dialog with this option.</b></p>

  <div>
    <h3><a name="d0e566" id="d0e566"></a>View Object XML</h3>
  </div>

  <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1050" src="images/input.jpg" border="0" height="121" width="293"></p>

  <p>This menu option allows a user to view the xml, but not edit.
  XML may be cut and pasted into another application using standard
  keyboard commands of the host operating system, (e.g. CTL-C,
  CTL-V in Windows) if desired.</p>

  <div>
    <h3><a name="d0e574" id="d0e574"></a>Change Repository</h3>
  </div>

  <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1051" src="images/login.jpg" border="0" height="184" width="279"></p>

  <p>The Change Repository option allows a repository administrator
  to login to a different Fedora repository. When selected, this
  menu option causes the Login dialog to be displayed. The
  repository administrator may then select a different Fedora
  server with which to connect, entering the appropriate login name
  and password.</p>

  <div>
    <h3><a name="d0e582" id="d0e582"></a>Exit</h3>
  </div>

  <p>The Exit menu option closes all connections with the Fedora
  server instance and logs the user out of the repository.</p>

  <div>
    <h2><a name="d0e587" id="d0e587"></a>Tools Menu</h2>
  </div>

  <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1052" src="images/tools_menu.jpg" border="0" height="308" width="400"></p>

  <p>Commands on the Tools menu provide the user with the ability
  to search and retrieve objects from the repository, build and
  ingest batches of digital objects, and under the console submenu,
  gain access directly to API-M and API-A methods for testing
  purposes.</p>

  <div>
    <h3><a name="d0e595" id="d0e595"></a>Search/Browse
    Repository</h3>
  </div>

  <p>The Search/Browse Repository menu option provides a mechanism
  for searching and retrieving objects from the Fedora repository.
  Upon ingestion, metadata from the Fedora System Metadata section
  and the Dublin Core (DC) Metadata section of the object are
  indexed in a relational database, and may be searched using this
  menu option. The DC Metadata section is an optional
  Implementer-Defined XML Metadata datastream in the object, where
  the <em>Datastream ID</em> is DC, and the XML conforms to the
  schema at <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd" target="_top">http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd</a>. If a
  Dublin Core metadata datastream is not provided, Fedora will
  construct a minimal DC datastream consisting of the elements
  dc:title and dc:identifier. The value for dc:title will be
  obtained from the object's label (if present in the object) and
  the value for dc:identifier will be assigned to the object's
  persistent identifier or PID.</p>

  <p>The search interface provides both simple and advanced
  searching. All queries are case insensitive. Simple Search
  enables queries of words and phrases occurring anywhere in than
  object's indexed metadata fields. Advanced Search enables fielded
  searching across any combination of metadata elements using
  string comparison operators (&nbsp; = and ~&nbsp;) for string
  fields, and value comparison operators (&nbsp; =, &gt;, ≥, &lt;, ≤ &nbsp;) for date fields (dc:date fields may be treated as
  both). The wildcards, * and ? may be used in any string-based
  query.</p>

  <div>
    <h4><a name="d0e608" id="d0e608"></a>Simple Search Tab</h4>
  </div>

  <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1053" src="images/simplesearch.jpg" border="0" height="314" width="400"></p>

  <p>The Simple Search tab is the default selection in the Search
  Repository window. The Simple Search query searches both the
  Dublin Core metadata and the Fedora System Metadata fields.</p>

  <p>At the top of the Search window, the user may select fields to

  <p>The Simple Search searches all indexed metadata fields for the
  text entered into the text box. All searches are case
  insensitive. The wildcard character '*'; can be substituted for
  any string of characters. The wildcard character '?'; can be
  substituted for any single character. Clicking <em>Search</em>
  will retrieve a list of objects where the entered text string
  appears in an indexed metadata field.</p>

  <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1055" src="images/searchadvanced.jpg" border="0" height="314" width="400"></p>

  <p>The Advanced Search query enables users to refine their

  values provided in the query.</p>

  <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1056" src="images/srch_adv_cond_dialog.jpg" border="0" height="110" width="416"></p>

  <p>The search conditions can be modified by clicking the
  <em>Add</em> button, which opens the Enter Condition dialog. The
  user selects the field to be defined from the drop down menu,
  selects the condition to be matched, and enters the text to be
  matched, if appropriate. Clicking <em>OK</em> saves the
  condition. Once all conditions are entered, clicking
  <em>Search</em> will retrieve a list of objects in which all
  conditions are met.</p>

  <div>
    <h4><a name="d0e651" id="d0e651"></a>Search Results Window</h4>
  </div>

  <p>The Search Results Window displays the results of a successful
  search in a table format. Across the top of the table are a row
  of labels of the fields that have been returned from the objects
  meeting the search criteria. Double clicking anywhere on a row
  opens that object. Right clicking anywhere on a row opens a
  pop-up menu that contains object level tasks from which the user
  may select. These tasks include <em>Open Object</em>, <em>View
  Object XML</em>, <em>Export ...</em>, <em>Purge</em>, and <em>Set
  Object State To</em>. If <em>Set Object State To</em> is
  selected, a submenu will provide the user with valid states from
  which to select.</p>

  <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1057" src="images/searchpopupmenu.jpg" border="0" height="308" width="400"></p>

  <p>The <em>Purge</em> and <em>Set Object State To</em> submenu
  options can be used on multiple objects by using mouse clicks or
  the equivalent keyboard commands to multiselect rows in the
  Search Results Window. In this way, groups of objects can be
  purged from the system, or have their states changed by means of
  one search and retrieval operation.</p>

    <h3><a name="d0e685" id="d0e685"></a>Batch</h3>
  </div>

  <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1058" src="images/tools_batch.jpg" border="0" height="314" width="400"></p>

  <p>The Batch menu item includes tools to create and ingest
  multiple Fedora objects, which are FOXML documents or
  Fedora-specific METS documents contained in files outside the
  repository. The Batch Modify tool is also included here and
  allows users to modify batches of already-ingested Fedora
  objects.</p>

  <h4>Ingest</h4>

  <p>It's simple to ingest objects created by one-up edit or by
  custom scripting.</p>

  
<p>The Batch menu also supports building objects. This takes a general template 
  common to all objects in a batch and makes object-specific substitutions into 
  the template. The template can be either a Fedora METS XML document or a Fedora 
  FOXML document and contains data common to the objects of the batch. Separate 
  XML documents hold the per-object substitution values. The format of the template 
  (FOXML or METS) determines the format of the built objects.</p>

  <p>The relatedness of objects in a batch is defined by what
  Fedora Administrator allows to be substituted and by which
  substitutions you choose to make. Data from the template are
  retained, unless replaced per individual object, including XML
  comments.</p>

  <p>Fedora Administrator provides for three modes of object batch
  processing: <b>batch build</b>, <b>batch ingest</b>, and a
  combined <b>batch build and ingest</b>.</p>

  
<p>This phased processing is shown in the following diagram.</p>

    <h4><a name="d0e1201" id="d0e1201"></a>Object-Specifics</h4>
  </div>

  
<p><em>Object-specifics</em> are coded in XML files. These data include: object 
  ID, label, and comment; datastream and object metadata and accompanying label; 
  datastream URLs, titles, and labels. Prior to Fedora 2.1b, there was no formal 
  <i>batchMerge</i> schema for object-specific files and the schema was implied 
  based on the example object-specific files. The new <i>batchMerge.xsd</i> schema 
  provides a more formal definition that conforms to the pre-Fedora 2.1b object-specific 
  examples and also provides some new extensions for attributes introduced with 
  <i>FOXML</i>. The new schema can be found at: <a href="http://www.fedora.info/definitions/1/0/api/batchMerge.xsd"> 
  http://www.fedora.info/definitions/1/0/api/batchMerge.xsd</a>. </p>
<p>Where possible, attribute names on elements are the same as in the Fedora <i>METS</i> 
  or <i>FOXML</i> schema, and so correspond to like-named attributes in the Fedora 
  <i>METS</i> or <i>FOXML</i> template. How these map is described below and by 
  running the demo and viewing the results for one of the objects.</p>

  
<p>Any individual substitution is optional. When absent as a substitution, the 
  value in the template will be used for the resulting Fedora <i>METS</i> or <i>FOXML</i> 
  object. (Demo template and <em>object-specific</em> contents are chosen instructively 
  to highlight substitutions made.) Datastream URLs will generally be specific 
  to an object; practice will show which other substitutions are generally made.</p>

  
<p>All <i>non-METS</i> and <i>non-FOXML</i> namespaces used in your own metadata 
  must be declared, as in <b>xmlns:uvalibadmin</b> in the demo.</p>

  
<p>The <i>metadata</i> element is for backward compatibility with pre-Fedora 2.1b 
  <i>object-specific</i> file formats where inline XML metadata was treated separately 
  from other types of datastreams. It is recommended that users use the new extended 
  <i>datastream</i> element for all types of datastreams. The <i>metadata</i> 
  element may be deprecated in a future release of the batchMerge schema. </p>
<p>When working with a <i>METS</i> template object:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Datastream IDs here map to those found in the Fedora <b>METS:fileGrp</b> 
    element (the nested, not the nesting, one). The associated <b>xlink:href</b> 
    and <b>xlink:title</b> attributes are substituted into the Fedora <b>METS:Flocat</b> 
    element, which is nested within that Fedora <b>METS:fileGrp</b> element.</p>
  <p>Datastream labels substitute instead into <b>METS:structMap.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When working with a <i>FOXML</i> template object:.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Datastream IDs here map to the <b>ID</b> attribute found in the Fedora <b>foxml:datastream 
    </b>element. The associated <b>xlink:href</b> attribute maps to the <b>REF</b> 
    attribute found in the Fedora <b>foxml:contentLocation</b> element. The <b>xlink:title</b> 
    attribute is for backward compatibility. Both datastream <b>LABEL</b> and 
    <b>xlink:title</b> attributes map to the <b>LABEL</b> attribute found in the 
    Fedora <b>foxml:datastreamVersion</b> element. It is recommended that you 
    use the <b>LABEL</b> attribute instead of the <b>xlink:title</b> attribute 
    when referring to the label of a datastream.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Case matters in attribute and element names.</p>

  
<p>Fedora will retain as PIDs only <b>OBJIDs</b> whose prefixes are included in 
  the fedora.fcfg file retainPids parameter (e.g., test, demo, etc.). Other <b>OBJIDs</b> 
  will be replaced by Fedora-generated PIDs.</p>

  <p><em>object-specs</em> in a given batch should meet the
  structural requirements of that batch's template: same number and
  tagging of datastreams, same number and tagging of metadata
  elements. Since substitutions are optional, individual
  <em>object-specs</em> cannot have "missing" data: the resulting
  object simply retains the template's value. Neither can
  <em>object-specs</em> have "extra" data: the resulting object
  simply lacks the <em>object-spec's</em> data -- because the
  template isn't designed to use it. In either case, the batch goes
  on.</p>

  
<p>The following <em>object-spec</em> fragment from <i>americanacademy.xml</i> 
  illustrates some of this.</p>

    <h4><a name="d0e1289" id="d0e1289"></a>Progress Report
    File</h4>
  </div>

  <p>Fedora Administrator already provides a progress report of
  each use of a batch tool, written to a GUI window, to provide
  user feedback. Additionally, this progress report is now written
  to a text file, to provide a permanent record.</p>

  <p>[Note that this progress report is not especially suited and
  is not intended for further processing by another computer
  program. Use the "object processing map", a different output file
  already provided, for such machine processing.]</p>

  <p>The progress report file is written to the same directory as
  the object processing map. The name of any instance of these new
  files includes the time when it is written, e.g.,
  20031203-123201-365.txt [The final group of numerals would serve
  to differentiate report files written, oddly but possibly, at the
  same second, by 2 instances of the GUI client running on the same
  machine.]</p>

  <p>The following description tells what is recorded in this new
  file and how its directory is chosen in giving the location of
  the object processing map.</p>

  <p>The batch tools are available through the Tools menu, under
  Batch, and serve to provide: Build Batch, Build and Ingest Batch,
  or Ingest Batch.</p>

  <p>After selecting one of these tools, a dialog box opens for
  user input of tool parameters. This dialog box is titled "Batch
  Build", "Batch Build and Ingest", or "Batch Ingest", depending on
  which tool is chosen. For each tool, one of the required
  parameters is the path to the "object processing map" (an output
  file), which records the tool's processing in a form amendable to
  later input to another program. This path is specified in a usual
  file dialog, including its parent directory.</p>

  <p>This is the parent directory, also, into which the new
  processing report file is written.</p>

  <p>The contents of this new file is simply the contents of the
  respective output window of the GUI client, one of : "Batch Build
  Output", "Batch Build and Ingest Output", or "Batch Ingest
  Output".</p>

  <h3>Batch Modify</h3>

  <p>The Batch Modify Utility is an application that enables the
  modification of objects in batch mode. It is designed for use by
  repository administrators and is available under the Tools menu
  of the Administrator GUI client. It can also be invoked as a
  command-line utility using either the fedora-modify.bat (Windowx)
  or fedora-modify.sh (unix) scripts located in the distribution
  client/bin directory.</p>

  <p>The basic design of the utility is to process an xml input
  file containing modify directives and then process each directive
  in sequence using the methods of API-M. The format of the
  directives file is specified by an xml schema name
  batchModify.xsd. The schema is available in the local
  distribution in the tomcat ROOT webapp and is also available from
  the Fedora website at <a href="http://www.fedora.info/definitions/1/0/api/batchModify.xsd">http://www.fedora.info/definitions/1/0/api/batchModify.xsd</a>.
  Each modify directive mirrors the capability of the corresponding
  API-M directives.</p>

  <h4>Process Directives</h4>

  <p>The Batch Modify Utility is accessed through the Tools menu of
  the Administrator GUI client under the submenu heading of
  Batch/Modify Batch.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/image002.jpg" border="0" height="382" width="532"></p>

  <p>The Modify Batch menu contains two sub-items named Process
  Directives and Validate Directives File. The Process Directives
  menu item is used to begin processing a valid set of xml
  directives in a modify directives file. The Validate Directives
  File item is used to parse an existing batch modify directives
  file to insure that it conforms to the Fedora Batch Modify XML
  schema.</p>

  <p>Selecting the Process Directives item will prompt for the
  location of the directives file.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/image003.jpg" border="0" height="506" width="707"></p>

  <p>After selecting a directives file, you will be asked to
  confirm the choice.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/image004.jpg" border="0" height="114" width="568"></p>

  <p>Upon clicking the yes button, the directives file will be
  processed and a log file generated that details the number of
  directives processed and any errors that may have occurred.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/image005.jpg" border="0" height="154" width="315"></p>

  <p>If there were any errors, you can peruse the log file to
  ascertain more information about what caused the directive to
  fail.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/image006.jpg" border="0" height="151" width="513"></p>

  <p>The log file consists of an xml file containing entries for
  each directive that was processed.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/image008.jpg" border="0" height="487" width="624"></p>

  <h4>Validate Directives</h4>

  <p>The Validate Directives menu item is used to verify that an
  existing directives file is valid before attempting to process
  the file. This can be useful when the directive files were
  created using a non-xml editor that was unable to validate the
  file as it was created. The steps for validating a directive file
  are similar to that for processing. First you are prompted for
  the location of the directives file to be processed.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/image009.jpg" border="0" height="446" width="624"></p>

  <p>Confirming the file location initiates the parsing process and
  the results are displayed when parsing is completed.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/image010.jpg" border="0" height="115" width="568"></p>

  <p><img alt="" src="images/image011.jpg" border="0" height="153" width="558"></p>

  <h4>To Demo</h4>

  <p>There is a sample batch modify directives file included in the
  distribution located in the dist/client/demo/batch-demo directory
  named modify-batch-directives.xml. This sample file creates a new
  object and then performs various additions, deletions, and
  modifications to the object's components through s series of
  directives. For reference the the sample directives file is
  included below.</p>

  <h4>Using Command Line with Modify Batch</h4>

  <p>The Modify Batch utility can also be run from the command line
  using the fedora-modify.bat (Windows) or the fedora-modify.sh
  (unix) scripts. These are located in the distribution in the
  dist/client/bin directory. Arguments for these scripts mirror
  those required in the interactive GUI interface.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <div>
      fedora-modify.bat
    </div>

    <div>
      fedora-modify.sh&lt;&lt;/div&gt;
    </div>
  </blockquote>

  <div>
    <p>Usage: fedora-modify? host port username password
    directives-filepath log-filepath validate-only-option</p>

    <p>Where</p>
  </div>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>host</strong> Fedora server host</li>

    <li><strong>port</strong> Fedora server port</li>

    <li><strong>username</strong> Fedora admin username</li>

    <li><strong>password</strong> Fedora admin password</li>

    <li><strong>directives-filepath</strong> filepath of the modify
    directives file</li>

    <li><strong>log-filepath</strong> filepath for the log
    filevValidate-only-option Boolean toggle determining whether to
    validate only ( true validate only, false process
    directives)</li>
  </ul>

      <h3><a name="d0e1308" id="d0e1308"></a>Console</h3>
    </div>

    <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1066" src="images/tools_console.jpg" border="0" height="308" width="400"></p>

    <p>The options under the Console submenu give developers direct
    access to the methods in the Fedora APIs and to the
    Stdout/Stderr window. In this way, development tools calling
    API methods can be more efficiently tested.</p>

    <p>These console windows are not intended for casual users or
    repository administrators, therefore they contain no guiding
    text to assist users in their function. Developers should
    carefully read the Fedora Technical Specification to understand
    the parameters required for each method in the Fedora APIs.</p>

    <div>
      <h2><a name="d0e1318" id="d0e1318"></a>Builders</h2>
    </div>

    <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1067" src="images/builders_menu.jpg" border="0" height="298" width="400"></p>

    <p>The Builders submenu gives users access to the Behavior
    Definition Builder and the Behavior Definition Builder. These
    WSDL objects are of such complex structure that it was
    necessary to create a wizard-like tool to enable users to
    construct custom Behavior Definitions and Behavior
    Mechanisms.</p>

    <p>The complexity of the task requires that extensive help be
    available within the Fedora Administrator interface, so on
    every pane of these builders, users will find a Help button.
    Clicking this button, opens a help screen that guides the user
    through the data on that pane.</p>

    <div>
      <h2><a name="d0e1328" id="d0e1328"></a>Window Menu</h2>
    </div>

    <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1068" src="images/window_menu.jpg" border="0" height="298" width="400"></p>

    <p>The Window menu contains standard commands for managing
    multiple panes open in the Fedora Administrator window. These
    include:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Cascade</p>

      <p>Tile</p>

      <p>Minimize All</p>

      <p>Restore All</p>
    </blockquote>

    <div>
      <h2><a name="d0e1349" id="d0e1349"></a>Help Menu</h2>
    </div>

    <p><img alt="" id="_x0000_i1069" src="images/help_menu.jpg" border="0" height="308" width="400"></p>

    <p>The help menu has two options:</p>

    <p>Documentation: which gives users the URL to the online
    documentation for Fedora.</p>

    <p>About Fedora Administrator: which provides version
    information, and copyright and licensing notices.</p>
