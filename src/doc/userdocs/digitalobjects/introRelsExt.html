        <h2 id="what">What are Fedora Digital Object Relationships?</h2>
        <span class="plaintext">
          Fedora digital objects can be related to other Fedora objects in many 
    ways. For example there may be a Fedora object that represents a collection 
    and other objects that are members of that collection.  Also, it may be the 
    case that one object is considered a part of another object, a derivation of 
    another object, a description of another object, or even equivalent to 
    another object. For example, consider a network of digital 
	objects pertaining to Thomas Jefferson, in which scholarly works are stored 
	as digital objects, which are related to other digital objects representing 
	primary source materials in libraries or museums. The composite 
	scholary objects can be considered a graph of related digital objects. 
	Other types of objects can also be related to the scholarly object over 
	time, for instance annotations about the scholarly object can be created by 
	others and related to the original object. Also, digital objects 
	can be created to act as &quot;surrogates&quot; or &quot;proxies&quot; for dynamically produced 
	web content such as an Amazon page for a book relevant to the scholarly 
	object. Such a network of digital objects can be created using 
	Fedora, which in the abstract, would look like this:
          <br />
          <br />

          <br />
          <br />
          Digital object relationship metadata is a way of asserting these various 
    kinds of relationships for Fedora objects. A default set of common 
    relationships is defined in the 
    <a href="http://www.fedora.info/definitions/1/0/fedora-relsext-ontology.rdfs">Fedora relationship ontology</a> 
	(actually, a simple RDF schema) which defines a set of common generic 
	relationships useful in creating digital object networks. These 
	relationships can be refined or extended. Also, communities can define 
	their own ontologies to encode relationships among Fedora digital objects. 
    Relationships are asserted from the perspective of one object to another 
    object as in the following general pattern:
          <code class="block">
<pre>
&lt;subjectFedoraObject&gt;    &lt;relationshipProperty&gt;    &lt;targetFedoraObject&gt;
</pre>
          </code>
          <br />
          The first Fedora object is considered the &quot;subject&quot; of the 
    relationship assertion.  The relationship, itself, is considered a property 
    of the subject.  The target Fedora object is the related object.  Thus, a 
    valid relationship assertion as an English-language sentence might be:
          <code class="block">
<pre>
&lt;MyCatVideo&gt;    &lt;is a member of the collection&gt;    &lt;GreatCatVideos&gt;
</pre>

        <h2 id="why">Why are Fedora Digital Object Relationships Important?</h2>
        <span class="plaintext">
          The creation of Fedora digital object relationship metadata is the 
    basis for enabling advanced access and management functionality driven from 
    metadata that is managed within the repository.  Examples of the uses of 
    relationship metadata include:
        </span>
            <ul>
              <li>Organize objects into collections to support management, OAI harvesting, and user search/browse</li>
              <li>Define bibliographic relationships among objects such as those defined in <a href="http://www.ifla.org/VII/s13/frbr/frbr.pdf">Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records</a></li>
          	  <li>Define semantic relationships among resources to record how objects relate to some external taxonomy or set of standards</li>
          	  <li>Model a network overlay where resources are linked together based on contextual information (for example citation links or collaborative annotations)</li>
          	  <li>Encode natural hierarchies of objects</li>
          	  <li>Make cross-collection linkages among objects (for example show that a particular document in one collection can also be considered part another collection)</li>
            </ul>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <h2 id="where">Where is Digital Object Relationship Metadata Stored?</h2>
        <span class="plaintext">
          Object-to-Object relationships are stored as metadata in digital objects 
    within a special datastream. This datastream is known by the reserved 
    datastream identifier of &quot;RELS-EXT&quot; 
    (which stands for &quot;Relationships-External&quot;).  Each digital object 
    can have one RELS-EXT datastream which is used exclusively for asserting 
    digital object relationships.
          <br />
          <br />
          A RELS-EXT datastream can be provided as part of a Fedora ingest file. 
    Alternatively, it can be added to an existing digital object via component 
    operations of the Fedora management service interface (i.e., addDatastream). 
    Refer to the <a href="foxml_reference_example.xml">FOXML reference example</a> 
    to see an example of the RELS-EXT datastream in context. Modifications to 
    the RELS-EXT datastream are made via the Fedora management interface 
    (i.e., modifyDatastream).
          <br />
          <br />
          The RELS-EXT datastream should be encoded as an Inline XML 
    datastream, meaning that the relationships metadata is expressed directly as 
    XML within the digital object XML file (as opposed the relationship metadata 
    existing in a separate XML file that the digital object points to by 
    reference).

        <h2 id="how">How is Digital Object Relationship Metadata Encoded?</h2>
        <span class="plaintext">
          Fedora object-to-object metadata is encoded in XML using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/">Resource Description Framework (RDF)</a>.   The relationship metadata must follow a prescribed RDF/XML authoring style where the subject is encoded using &lt;rdf:Description&gt;, the relationship is a property of the subject, and the target object is bound to the relationship property using the rdf:resource attribute.   The subject and target of a relationship assertion must be URIs that identify Fedora digital objects.  These URIs are based on Fedora object PIDs and conform to the syntax described for the <a href="http://info-uri.info/registry/OAIHandler?verb=GetRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=reg&amp;identifier=info:fedora/">fedora &quot;info&quot; URI scheme.</a>  The syntax for asserting relationships in RDF is as follows:
          <code class="block">
<pre>
&lt;rdf:RDF
  xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
  xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#"
  xmlns:fedora="info:fedora/fedora-system:def/relations-external#"
  xmlns:myns="http://www.nsdl.org/ontologies/relationships#"&gt;

  &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about="info:fedora/demo:99"&gt;
	&lt;fedora:isMemberOfCollection rdf:resource="info:fedora/demo:c1"/&gt;
	&lt;myns:isPartOf rdf:resource="info:fedora/mystuff:100"/&gt;
	&lt;myns:owner&gt;Jane Doe&lt;myns:owner/&gt;
  &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;

&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
</pre>
          </code>
          <br />
          The above RDF fragment indicates that the Fedora digital object 
      identified as &quot;info:fedora/demo:99&quot; is the subject that is being 
      described (as specified by the rdf:about attribute).  This object has two 
      relationships to other digital objects.  It has an 
      &quot;isMemberOfCollection&quot; relationship to the object identified as 
      &quot;info:fedora/demo:c1&quot; which is a Fedora object that represents a 
      collection.  This collection object is considered the target of the 
      relationship assertion.  The second relationship assertion that is 
      just like the first one, except that it asserts that the subject is a part 
      of another Fedora digital object, &quot;info:fedora/mystuff:100&quot;. The 
      third relationship asserts that the digital object has owner 
      &quot;Jane Doe&quot;. Note that the object of this relationship is a text 
      literal, not a URI.
          <br />
          <br />
          To ensure the integrity of relationship metadata so that it can be properly indexed by Fedora, the Fedora repository service validates all RELS-EXT datatreams and enforces the following constraints on the RDF:
        </span>
            <ol>
              <li>The subject must be encoded as an &lt;rdf:Description&gt; element, with an &quot;rdf:about&quot; attribute containing the URI of the digital object in which the RELS-EXT datastream resides.  Thus, relationships are asserted about this object only.  Relationship directionality is from this object to other objects.</li>
              <li>The relationship assertions must be RDF properties associated with the &lt;rdf:Description&gt;.  Relationship assertions can be properties defined in the default <a href="http://www.fedora.info/definitions/1/0/fedora-relsext-ontology.rdfs">Fedora relationship ontology</a>, or properties from other namespaces.</li>
              <li>Prior to 2.1, the objects of relationships were restricted to other Fedora digital object URIs. This has since been relaxed so that a relationship property may reference any URI or literal, with the following exception:  a relationship may not be self-referential, rdf:resource attribute must not point to the URI of the digital object that is the subject of the relationship.</li>
              <li>There must be only one &lt;rdf:Description&gt; in the RELS-EXT datastream.  One description can have as many relationship property assertions as necessary.</li>
              <li>There must be no nesting of assertions.  Specifically, there cannot be an &lt;rdf:Description&gt; within an &lt;rdf:Description&gt;.  In terms of XML &quot;depth,&quot; the RDF root is considered at the depth of zero.  The must be one &lt;rdf:Description&gt; element that must exist at the depth of one.  The relationship assertions are RDF properties of the &lt;rdf:Description&gt; that exist at a depth of two.</li>
              <li>Assertions of properties from certain namespaces for forbidden in RELS-EXT.  There must NOT be any assertion of properties from the Dublin Core namespace or from the FOXML namespace. This is because these assertions exist elsewhere in Fedora objects and may conflict if asserted in two places. The RELS-EXT datasream is intended to be dedicated to solely object-to-object relationships and not used to make general descriptive assertions about objects.</li>
            </ol>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <h2 id="indexed">Resource Index - RDF-based Indexing and Searching for Digital Objects</h2>
        <span class="plaintext">
          Yes!  The Fedora repository service automatically indexes the RELS-EXT datastreams for all objects as part of the 
		<a href="../server/resourceIndex/index.html">RDF-based Resource Index</a>.
          <br />
          <br />
          This provides a unified &quot;graph&quot; of all the objects in the repository and their relationships to each other.  The Resource Index graph can be queried using RDQL or ITQL which are SQL-like query languages for RDF. The Fedora repository service exposes an web service interface to search the Resource Index.  Please refer to the Resource Index documentation for details.
