        <span class="plaintext">
          Fedora 3.0 represents several significant updates to the Fedora codebase,
          primarily the addition of the content model architecture. In order to
          determine the performance impacts of these changes as well as to discover
          how configuration changes impact performance, a suite of tests were added
          to the source distribution. These tests are available to aid in understanding
          how the Fedora system works as well as to provide a starting point for
          performance tuning.
          <br/><br/>
          The following test results are available to allow for comparisons with your
          Fedora installation. These results currently represent only a limited number
          of configuration choices and will be updated in the future to provide a more
          complete picture, including both the results of more configuration choices on a
          Fedora 3.0 server, as well as comparisons between a 3.0 and a 2.2.x server.

        <span class="plaintext">
          Three tests are performed during each run:
        </span>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Round-Trip:</strong> Each operation is called and the time required to receive a response
            (indicating that the call has completed) is recorded. Each call in the round-trip
            test is performed in a consistent repository state, meaning that for each ingest
            operation a delete is performed before the next ingest. All calls are made using
            the same object and parameters. Only the time to perform the operation in question
            is recorded. Times for all iterations are averaged as the result.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Throughput:</strong> Each operation is called back-to-back with each call being performed
            on a different object. A timer is started at the beginning of the test and is stopped
            after all calls have been made and returned. The time to perform all operations is
            recorded as the result.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Threaded:</strong> Tests are conducted in the same manner as throughput tests except that
            a thread pool is utilized to perform the calls.
          </li>
        </ul>

          Tests were run for each of the following Fedora configurations. These configurations are shown in
