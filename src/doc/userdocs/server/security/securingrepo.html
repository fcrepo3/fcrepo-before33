    <h2><a name="INTRO"></a>1 Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>Fedora 2.1b represents the first release of Fedora that includes support for authentication, SSL, and authorization using XACML policies. This document provides an overview of the security configurations that ship with Fedora 2.1b and describes how to setup and configure Fedora to run in each of the four base security modes.</p>
    <p>Fedora 2.0 provided a very minimal level of security that consisted of the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
	<ul>
	  <li>API-M restricted by IP address to the hostname of "localhost"</li>
        <li>API-A unrestricted</li>
	  <li>Single super user with username of fedoraAdmin; password configurable in fedora.fcfg</li>
	  <li>no SSL support</li>
	</ul>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In Fedora 2.0, these security measures were handled through the fedora.fcfg file and special use of the single super user name(fedoraAdmin) in the codebase. In Fedora 2.1b, these security measures are now handled through a set of XACML policies and with authentication information provided through tomcat or external authentication sources.</p>

    <p>There are four base security configurations provided with the Fedora 2.1b server distribution: (1) "secure-apim" configuration, (2) "secure-all" configuration, (3) "unsecure-apim" configuration, and (4) "unsecure-all" configuration. Unlike Fedora 2.0, there is no longer a "default" configuration. Before starting the Fedora server, you 
	must run a server setup utility to select a base security configuration that 
	will be your base security configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp; After setup, you can customize that base configuration as needed.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Section 2.0 describes the server setup process and the nature of the 
	different base security configurations.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
  </div>

<div class="sect">
    <h2><a name="CONFIG"></a>2 Security Setup - Select One of Four Base Security 
	Configurations</h2>
	<p>To select your base security configuration, run the &quot;fedora-setup&quot; 
	command-line utility. This utility requires a single argument which is the 
	name of the base security configuration you wish to use.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
        &nbsp;Under Windows:</p>
      <div class="code">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %FEDORA_HOME%\server\bin\fedora-setup.bat <i><b>configuration-name</b></i></div>
      <p style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
        &nbsp;Under Unix:</p>
      <div class="code">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $FEDORA_HOME\server\bin\fedora-setup <i><b>configuration-name</b></i></div>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>The possible values for<i><b> configuration-name</b></i> is one of the following:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	 <blockquote>
		<ul>
			<li>secure-apim</li>
			<li>secure-all</li>
			<li>unsecure-apim</li>
			<li>unsecure-all</li>
		</ul>
		</blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>The fedora-setup utility initializes one of the four base security configurations by copying a set of 
	configuration files into the distribution tree.&nbsp; The contents of these 
	configuration files will vary depending on the base security configuration selected.&nbsp; The 
	resultant functionality of the four possible base security configurations are described in more detail 
	below.&nbsp;&nbsp; The setup utility <i><b>automatically</b></i> puts an 
	appropriate version of the three necessary Fedora configuration files into 
	play:</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><b>fedora.fcfg </b>- Fedora server configuration file</p>
	<p><b>web.xml </b>- Fedora Tomcat web application configuration file; controls whether basic authentication and SSL are enabled for API-M and API-A</p>
	<p><b>beSecurity.xml</b> - Fedora backend services configuration file; 
	controls security for services calling back to Fedora (see &quot;beSecurity Configuration" document for details)</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<div class="sect2">
      <h3><a name="CONFIG1"></a>2.1 SECURE-APIM Configuration</h3>
      
	<ul>
	  <li>API-M supports basic authentication and SSL</li>
	  <li>API-A unrestricted (i.e., open access)</li>
	  <li>backend services security is minimal</li>

    	</ul>
		<p>The secure-apim configuration is designed for repositories that desire a secure management interface for administering and maintaining a repository, but wish to keep access to the repository content completely open.</p>
    </div>

 
   <div class="sect2">
      <h3><a name="CONFIG2"></a>2.2 SECURE-ALL Configuration</h3>

	 <ul>
	  <li>API-M supports basic authentication and SSL</li>
	  <li>API-A supports basic authentication and SSL</li>
	  <li>backend service security is enhanced by limiting backend service communication only from specified IP addresses</li>
	 </ul>

	<p>The secure-all configuration is designed for repositories that desire full security for both management and access and also want to add additional security regarding how backend services are allowed to communicate with the Fedora server. Note that when authentication is enabled for API-A, the hostname used for the "fedoraServerHost" parameter in fedora.fcfg must be a resolvable, fully qualified domain name. You cannot use just "localhost" or "127.0.0.1" since remote backend services use this as the hostname to communicate with the fedora server.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="sect2">
      <h3><a name="CONFIG3"></a>2.3 UNSECURE-APIM Configuration</h3>

	  <ul>
	   <li>API-M supports basic authentication <b><i>but no SSL</i></b>; restricted by IP to localhost</li>
	   <li>API-A unrestricted (i.e., open access)</li>
	   <li>backend security security is minimal</li>

		</ul>
		<p>The unsecure-apim configuration is designed for repositories that desire to simulate the security that was available in Fedora 2.0. Note that this configuration does not use SSL on API-M so authentication passwords are in clear text and API-A is completely unrestricted. This configuration is NOT recommended for any repositories requiring a secure environment. Note that because there is no basic authentication for API-A, you also cannot write policies for API-A that use any user attribute information.</p>
   </div>

  <div class="sect2">
      <h3><a name="CONFIG4"></a>2.4 UNSECURE-ALL Configuration</h3>

	 <ul>
	  <li>API-M supports basic authentication <i><b>but no SSL</b></i>; restricted by IP to localhost</li>
	  <li>API-A supports basic authentication <i><b>but no SSL</b></i></li>
	  <li>backend security security is minimal</li>
	 </ul>

	<p>The unsecure-all configuration is designed for repositories that want the features of basic authentication for both API-M and API-a, but are not ready to tackle some of the additional issues imposed by SSL with their client-side or middleware applications. Note that since there is no SSL support for either API-A any authentication passwords are in clear text. This configuration is NOT recommended for any repositories requiring a secure environment. Since API-A and API-M both support basic authentication, you can write policies for both API-M and API-A that use user-based attributes. This configuration can be a good choice if you want to experiment with policy writing for API-M and API-A, but are not ready to tackle SSL and security is not a concern. Note that when authentication is enabled for API-A, the hostname used for the "fedoraServerHost" parameter in fedora.fcfg must be a resolvable, fully qualified domain name. You cannot use just "localhost" or "127.0.0.1" since remote backend services use this as the hostname to communicate with the fedora server.</p>

	 <h2><a name="CONFIG-CUSTOM"></a>3 Customized Security Configurations</h2>

	 <p>After selecting a base security configuration and running "fedora-setup", you can then begin customizing your configuration. Care must be exercised when performing customizations since there are some dependencies in the three configuration files: fedora.fcfg, beSecurity.xml, and web.xml that must be preserved.</p>

	<blockquote>
	<p><strong>fedora.fcfg</strong> - The Fedora server configuration file is 
	found in the Fedora configuration directory ($FEDORA_HOME\server\config).&nbsp; The fedora.fcfg configuration file can be customized as needed as it was in Fedora 2.0 with one exception. The value of the parameter named "doMediateDatastreams" that is in the API-A module section is dependent on the authentication setting for API-A. If authentication is disabled for API-A, then the setting for "doMediateDatastreams" should be set to "false". If authentication is enabled for API-A, then "doMediateDatastreams" should be set to "true". This value is set appropriately in the four base configurations, but if you begin creating your own custom configuration, you need to be sure that the appropriate value is used for "doMediateDatastreams". Also remember that when doMediateDatastreams is set to true, the hostname used for the "fedoraServerHost" in fedora.fcfg must be a resolvable, fully qualified domain name. You cannot use just "localhost" since remote backend services use this hostname to communicate with the fedora server.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>web.xml</strong> - The web.xml configuration file is found in the 
	Fedora Tomcat web application directory under the Fedora Tomcat path ($FEDORA_HOME\server\jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28\webapps\fedora\WEB-INF).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	This file controls the settings for authentication and SSL forwarding for API-M and API-A.&nbsp;
	<i><b>It is strongly recommended that you do not customize this file</b></i> unless you have very special needs that cannot be met by one of the four base configuration files. If you decide you have to customize this file, here are some helpful pointers to keep in mind:</p>

	<ul>
	 <li>fedora.fcfg - remember that if authentication is enabled for API-A, you must also set doMediateDatastreams to true in fedora.fcfg</li>
		<li>beSecurity - remember that settings for authentication and SSL forwarding for API-A must mesh with settings in beSecurity.xml</li>
		<li>XACML policies - remember that policies that use "Subject" attributes are only available if the corresponding API has 
		authentication enabled</li>
		<li>authentication and SSL - remember that settings for authentication and SSL can affect the settings in fedora.fcfg, beSecurity, and in written policies so exercise care when making changes</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>beSecurity.xml</strong> -&nbsp; The Fedora backend security configuration file is 
	found in the Fedora configuration directory ($FEDORA_HOME\server\config).&nbsp; 
	Customization of this file is only relevant for repositories that are using 
	custom disseminators that point to external services.&nbsp; If you want to 
	set up a totally secure repository, you must configure things up so that 
	external services can securely call back to the Fedora repository.&nbsp;&nbsp; Customization of the beSecurity.xml configuration file is described in detail in the document entitled "beSecurity Configuration". The main issue to remember when customizing beSecurity is that it controls how backend services communicate with the Fedora server and how the Fedora server communicates with backend services. Hence, you have to be aware of what setting you are using for API-A in regards to authentication and SSL support. For example, if you have authentication and SSL support turned off for API-A, it would not make sense to have a beSecurity setting that tries to enable authentication or SSL when a backend service is attempting to connect to the Fedora server. Note also that beSecurity is only needed if you are using custom disseminators and care about how backend services communicate with the Fedora server. If this is not a concern, you can use the minimal beSecurity configuration file that is part of the secure-apim or unsecure-apim configurations.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>tomcat-users-fedoraTemplate.xml</strong> - This a Fedora-specific 
	template file is found in the Fedora Tomcat directory ($FEDORA_HOME\server\jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28\conf).&nbsp; 
	If you are using the default Tomcat authentication (out-of-the-box with 
	Fedora 2.0), you will probably need to add new users.&nbsp; This is done by 
	making additions to the Fedora-specific template (tomcat-users-fedoraTemplate.xml) which is 
	<b><i>automatically converted </i></b>into a runtime Tomcat users 
	configuration file (i.e., tomcat-users.xml). New entries will be necessary here if you are using the tomcat-users file for authentication and you add additional authenticated users and also if you customize beSecurity.xml with new usernames, passwords, or roles. See the section on "Tomcat Users File" for 
	additional details in customizing the tomcat-users file.</p>
	</blockquote>
   </div>

   <div class="sect">
	<h2><a name="AUTHN"></a>4 Authentication</h2>

	<p>The Fedora server is built on top of Apache's tomcat and authentication information is channeled through the normal tomcat mechanisms. Fedora currently provides two authentication plug-ins: (1) Simple user/password file, and (2) LDAP</p>
	<ol>
	  <li><p>tomcat-users.xml - simple user/password file</p>

		<p>This file is part of the tomcat configuration files and is auto-generated from the tomcat-user_fedoraTemplate.xml file. It contains username and password information about "authenticated" users. Roles can also be assigned to user entries which can then be used as attributes in related XACML policies. Refer to the next section entitled "Tomcat Users File" for details concerning the contents of the tomcat users file.</p></li>

	  <li><p>LDAP</p>

		<p>The configuration of tomcat to use LDAP for authentication follows the standard rules outlined by the apache tomcat group. Refer to
http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-5.0-doc/realm-howto.html#JNDIRealm  for details on how to configure tomcat to use LDAP for authentication.<p></li>
	</ol>

	<p>Other methods of authentication are possible, but require writing your own custom LoginModule or JAASModule for tomcat. The Fedora code is "aware" of any user that is authenticated through tomcat. For more details on the Fedora security architecture, refer to the document entitled "Fedora Security Architecture - Authentication".</p>

    <div class="sect">
	<h3><a name="AUTHN-TOMCAT"></a>4.1&nbsp; Option A - Default Authentication 
	Plug-In&nbsp; (Tomcat Memory Realm with Tomcat Users File)</h3>

<p>Fedora is configured out-of-the-box with the Tomcat Memory Realm login module 
enabled.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this login module, the source of user identity 
information is the file named "tomcat-users.xml" which is automatically generated by the Fedora server at startup based on the contents of the template file named "tomcat-users_fedoraTemplate.xml".&nbsp;&nbsp; 
It is recommended that you make changes to this template file instead of the 
generated file.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each time the server is started a new tomcat-users.xml 
will be generated.&nbsp;&nbsp; The template file is located:</p>

<p>In source distribution:</p>

<p><blockquote>Unix:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $FEDORA_HOME/inc/server/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.8/conf/tomcat-users_fedoraTemplate.xml<p>
		Windows:&nbsp; %FEDORA_HOME%\inc\server\jakarta-5.0.8\conf\tomcat-users_fedoraTemplate.xml</p>
	</blockquote></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>In binary distribution:</p>

<p><blockquote>Unix:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $FEDORA_HOME/server/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.8/conf/tomcat-users_fedoraTemplate.xml
		<p>Windows:&nbsp; %FEDORA_HOME%\server\jakarta-tomcat-5.0.8\conf\tomcat-users_fedoraTemplate.xml</p>
	</blockquote></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>By default, the template contains the following users, passwords, and roles:</p>

	<div class="code">
	  <tomcat-users>
        <user name="#1" password="#2" roles="fedoraRole=administrator" />
        <user name="fedoraIntCallUser" password="changeme" roles="fedoraRole=fedoraInternalCall-1" />  
        <user name="surrogate64" password="surrogate64" roles="webfrontend" />  
        <user name="guest" password="" roles="" />
	  &lt;tomcat-users&gt;<br>
		&lt;user name=&quot;#1&quot; password=&quot;#2&quot; roles=&quot;fedoraRole=administrator&quot;/&gt;<br>
		&lt;user name=&quot;fedoraIntCallUser&quot; password=&quot;changeme&quot; roles=&quot;fedoraRole=fedoraInternalCall-1&quot;/&gt;<br>
		&lt;user name=&quot;surrogate64&quot; password=&quot;surrogate64&quot; roles=&quot;webfrontend&quot;/&gt;<br>
		&lt;user name=&quot;testuser1&quot; password=&quot;testuser1&quot; roles=&quot;fedoraRole=professor&quot;/&gt;<br>
		&lt;user name=&quot;testuser2&quot; password=&quot;testuser2&quot; roles=&quot;fedoraRole=researcher&quot;/&gt;<br>
		&lt;user name=&quot;testuser3&quot; password=&quot;testuser3&quot; roles=&quot;fedoraRole=student&quot;/&gt;<br>
		&lt;user name=&quot;testuser4&quot; password=&quot;testuser4&quot; roles=&quot;fedoraRole=visitor&quot;/&gt;<br>
		&lt;user name=&quot;guest&quot; password=&quot;&quot; roles=&quot;&quot;/&gt;<br>
		&lt;/tomcat-users&gt;</tomcat-users></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>The placeholders indicated by #1 and #2 will be substituted with the values specified for adminUsername(default is fedoraAdmin) and adminPassword(default is fedoraAdmin) specified in the fedora.fcfg file at server startup time. To change these values, make the changes in fedora.fcfg and leave the #1, and #2 markers unchanged in tomcat-suers-fedoraTemplate.xml. The role of "fedoraRole=administrator" is a special role that grants super user privileges for the Fedora server and should not be edited.</p>

<p>The username of "fedoraIntCallUser" is also a special Fedora system user. The role of "fedoraRole=fedoraInternalCall-1" grants special system privileges to this user. This username is used as the authenticating user when the fedora server needs to make calls to itself. The values for username and password may be edited, but you should leave the role unchanged. If you do change the username or password, you must also update these values in the beSecurity.xml file.</p>

<p>The third entry provides a username that can be used when a webfrontend is authenticated outside of Fedora and you want that authenticated webfrontend user to then be able to authenticate with fedora. You can edit this entry as needed, but the value used for role must match the value specified in the corresponding surrogate user policy. An example of a repository wide policy that uses a surrogate user can be found in the set of example policies under the name "permit-webfrontend-as-surrogate.xml". This example policy uses the role of "webfrontend" which corresponds to the value in the tomcat-users-fedoraTemplate.xml file. See the next section concerning "JAAS Config File" for additional details regarding configuring a surrogate user.</p>

<p>[This section may change depending on what we decide on how to handle updating of tomcat-users file and whether we decide to provide additional documentation re configuring authentication via ldap. Needs more input from Bill when he has time ....]</p>

<p>Fedora 2.1b extends several of the tomcat realm classes in org.apache.catalina.realm to facilitate the passing of attribute values. For complete details of the extensions, see the document entitled "Fedora Security Architecture - Authentication". In brief, the extensions enable the ability to include multiple attributes using the tomcat "roles" attribute by separating attributes with a comma. e.g.,</p>

	<div class="code">
	  roles="attribute1,attribute2,attribute3"
	<div?

<p>In addition, the extensions include the ability to represent attributes as name=value pairs allowing you to specify both the attribute name and value as opposed to just the value. e.g.,</p>

	<div class="code">
	  roles="fedoraRole=administrator,fedoraRole=demo:9/getThumbnail"
	</div>

<p>The extensions also provide a multiplexor capability that enables attributes from authenticated sources other than tomcat-users to be gathered at authentication time. If you want to make changes to any of the user, password, or role settings, make the changes in the tomcat-users_fedoraTemplate.xml file prior to starting the server. If you make them in the tomcat-users.xml file, the changes will be overwritten by what is in the template when the server starts. When users are prompted to provide basic authentication, their credentials are verified based on what is in the tomcat-users file.</p>

<p>In addition to username and password, you can also assign what tomcat refers to as "roles". You can think of these "roles" in the tomcat-users file as attributes about the user and are entered as name=value pairs. You can use "roles" to define groups of users and then write policies based on these attributes. With the multiplexor feature, you can also have access to attributes from other sources. For example, using jaas.config you could also configure a ldap server to provide additioinal attributes about an authenticated user. There is an example in the jaas.config file that demonstrates how to do this with the public UVa ldap server which is used to provide additional attribute information about authenticated users.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h3><a name="AUTHN-JAAS2"></a>4.3 Option C - Configuring Multiple Login 
		Modules (Multiplexing via Fedora's JAAS)</h3>

<p><i><b>&lt;bill - insert some general context and motivation here.&gt;</b></i></p>
		<p>The jaas.config file includes one or more login module configurations. The default shipped with Fedora 2.1b provides an entry for the basic JAASMemoryLoginModule that uses the tomcat-users.xml file.</p>

	<div class="code">
	org.apache.catalina.realm.JAASMemoryLoginModule 
	required 
	debug=true 
	path="conf/tomcat-users.xml"
	;
	</div>

<p>As configured, all authenticated users must have an entry in the tomcat-users-feodraTemplate.xml file.</p>

<p>It also includes two additional examples that are commented out. The first example is for a surrogate web frontend that enables end-user attributes to be gathered by a surrogate. This case is useful if you have a web-based frontend to the Fedora APIs that is authenticated outside of Fedora and you simply wish to use the outside authenticated user to be able to appear as authenticated to the Fedora server.</p>

	<div class="code">
	org.apache.catalina.realm.JAASMemoryLoginModule 
	required 
	debug=true 
	path="conf/tomcat-users.xml"
	;

	/** uncomment to enable end-user ldap attributes in case of surrogate
	org.apache.catalina.realm.JAASNullLoginModule 
	required debug=true;	
	**/
	</div>

<p>This allows attributes provided by the external authentication agent to be gathered in addition to any attributes associated with this user in the tomcat-users file. The second example is for an ldap server that is not used for authentication, but instead to provide additional attributes about an authenticated user.</p>

	<div class="code">
	org.apache.catalina.realm.JAASMemoryLoginModule 
	required 
	debug=true 
	path="conf/tomcat-users.xml"
	;

	/** uncomment to test against uva ldap; e.g., put wdn5e in tomcat-users.xml, it will match here
	org.apache.catalina.realm.JAASJNDILoginModule optional debug=true
	connectionURL="ldap://ldapvs.itc.virginia.edu:389"
	userBase="o=University of Virginia,c=US"
	userSearch="(uid={0})"
	userRoleName="objectClass,uid,ou,UnixUid,eduPersonOrgDN,eduPersonOrgUnitDN,eduPersonPrimaryAffiliation,eduPersonScopedAffiliation"
	userSubtree=true
	userPassword="NO_AUTHENTICATION"
	;
	**/
	</div>

<p>This allows attributes provided by the ldap server to be gathered in addition to any attributes associated with this user in the tomcat-users file. For example, if there is user entry in the tomcat-users file for "wdn5e", then this authenticated username will match against the corresponding entry in the ldap server and any attributes associated with the username "wdn5e" in the ldap server will also be available for use by Fedora.</p>

It is recommended that you start with one of the base security configurations and set of default policies and become familiar with the new security features of Fedora 2.1b. Then you can go back and experiment with customizing various aspects of your repository configuration and policies.</p>

	<blockquote>
	<ol>
	  <li>Select a base security configuration by running "fedora-setup"</li>
	  <li>Optionally customize fedora.fcfg for your repository</li>
	  <li>Optionally customize beSecurity.xml for your custom disseminators</li>
	  <li>Optionally customize repository-wide and object-specific policies</li>
	  <li>Optionally customize tomcat-users-fedoraTemplat.xml for your repository and users</li>
	  <li>Optionally customize jaas.config for your repository</li>
	  <li>Start the fedora server</li>
	</ol>
