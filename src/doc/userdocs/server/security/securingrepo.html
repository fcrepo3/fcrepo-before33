    <h2><a name="INTRO"></a>1 Introduction to Fedora servlet security filters</h2>
    
  <p>We here assume that you have already installed Fedora, in either quick or custom varieties.   
    This document gives advice on using Fedora's servlet security filters and 
    its surrogate feature.  These filters authenticate Fedora users and/or provide user attributes to use in XACML authorization.</p>
    
	<p>Fedora's servlet security filters are configured in the web deployment descriptor file (web.xml), typically 
	in Fedora's webapp directory in whatever servlet container (e.g., Tomcat) you've deployed Fedora in.  
	Section "Specifying Filter Configuration" in <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/Filters.html">The Essentials of Filters</a> discusses the format of specifying filters and filter-mappings
	and gives more information on the format of the servlet filter section of web.xml.   (That section 
does not have an anchored location to link to directly.)  It may be helpful to use the Fedora web.xml as guide
	while reading this document.</p>
	
	

	<p>The Fedora 
	installer will have configured several servlet filters in the correct order.  Leave these in the order given, 
	with the filter elements grouped first, and then the grouped filter-mapping elements following as a second group.  Within either filter or filter-mapping unit, 
	the filter definitions are ordered:  SetupFilter, XmlUserfileFilter, (LdapFilterForAttributes), (LdapFilterForGroups), 
	EnforceAuthnFilter, FinalizeFilter.  The filters in parenthesis are optional, and won't be installed by default.  Again, 
	retain this order and if you add a filter, use the place indicated.
</p>

<p>
The filter-mappings of the EnforceAuthnFilter determine which Fedora urls require user authentication.  The installer will set up 
these various mappings either for api-m alone or for both api-m and api-a urls/servlets.  You can customize web.xml for this,
likely by adding or deleting mappings for this filter, if you need and know.
</p>

<p>
Parameter settings are specific to a servlet filter, and are given below for the Fedora servlet security filters.
Here is the format which the specification takes in web.xml:
</p>

	<blockquote>&lt;filter&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;filter-name&gt;LdapFilterForAttributes&lt;/filter-name&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;filter-class&gt;fedora.server.security.servletfilters.ldap.FilterLdap&lt;/filter-class&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;init-param&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;param-name&gt;authenticate&lt;/param-name&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;param-value&gt;false&lt;/param-value&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>. . .</b><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/init-param&gt;<br/>
&lt;/filter&gt;
</blockquote>

<p>
Use this format to define in web.xml the parameter settings you need.

	 <h2><a name="CONFIG-CUSTOM"></a>3 Parameters for Ldap servlet filter for user attributes</h2>

<p>
The following parameters are useful for either LdapFilterForAttributes or LdapFilterForGroups.
The example values are chosen for LdapFilterForAttributes.  If you are setting up this filter, use 
"LdapFilterForAttributes" as filter-name, "fedora.server.security.servletfilters.ldap.FilterLdap" as filter-class, 
and choose values from the parameters below which fit your Ldap directory configuration for reading user <em>attributes</em>.  
You can also use parameters for either/both
Ldap authentication/binding and/or the surrogate feature, as explained elsewhere in this document.
You may need to talk to your directory administrator to find out these settings.

	 <h2><a name="CONFIG-CUSTOM"></a>4 Parameters to use Ldap servlet filter for user group memberships</h2>
	 
<p>
The following parameters are useful for LdapFilterForGroups and have example values chosen for LdapFilterForGroups.  
If you are setting up this filter, use 
"LdapFilterForGroups" as filter-name, "fedora.server.security.servletfilters.ldap.FilterLdap" as filter-class, 
and choose values for the parameters below which fit your Ldap directory configuration for reading <em>group</em> memberships.  
This will be more specific to your directory than for reading user attributes.
You can also use parameters for either/both
Ldap authentication/binding and/or the surrogate feature, as explained elsewhere in this document.
You may need to talk to your directory administrator to find out these settings.  Some directories will store
no group memberships, or store them in a way for which this servlet filter isn't configurable.

		<h2><a name="AUTHZ"></a>7 Authorization via XACML</h2>
		<p>Fedora 2.0 hardcoded minimal authorization constraints, beyond those provided by specifications in Tomcat's web.xml file.
		Fedora 2.1.1 instead exposes these to customization by encoding them in the XACML standard.  A complete

		<a href="AuthorizationXACML.htm">Fedora Authorization with XACML Policy Enforcement</a>.</p>
		<h3><a name="AUTHZ-DEFAULT"></a>7.1 Default Repository Policies</h3>

<p>Fedora 2.1.1 ships with a set of <a href="AuthorizationXACML.htm#DEFAULT">
default repository-wide XACML policies</a> that approximate the minimal security level provided by Fedora 2.0.&nbsp; This set of repository-wide policies includes the following policies:</p>



<h3><a name="AUTHZ-CUSTOM"></a>7.2 Custom Policies</h3>
		<p>Note that the default repository policies enforce a minimal level security (e.g., API-A is totally unrestricted).&nbsp; If you need a 
		more customized level of access control what is provided by the default, you will need to add additional repository-wide policies or individual object-specific policies to customize your access environment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Refer to the <a href="XACMLPolicyGuide.htm">Fedora

		<h2><a name="STEP-BY-STEP"></a>8 Step-By-Step Guide to Securing Your 
		Repository</h2>

<p>Here is a brief step-by-step guide that describes what you will need to do to configure your fedora repository. It is recommended that you start with the new installer and one of the base security configurations it creates and set of default policies and become familiar with the new installation and default security features of Fedora 2.2. Then you can go back and experiment with customizing various aspects of your repository configuration and policies.</p>

	<blockquote>
	    <ol>
          <li>Select a base security configuration by running "fedora-2.2.2-installer.jar"</li>
          <li>Optionally customize fedora.fcfg for your repository</li>
          <li>Optionally customize XACML policies (repository-wide and object-specific policies)</li>
          <li>Optionally customize fedora-users.xml for your repository and users</li>
          <li>Optionally customize web.xml to use servlet filters for authentication and user attributes</li>
          <li>Start the fedora server</li>
        </ol>
