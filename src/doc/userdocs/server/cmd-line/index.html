      <p>The Fedora server distribution comes with several
    useful command-line utilities.
    A description and usage instructions for each follows.</p>

    <p>
    The scripts are located in FEDORA_HOME/server/bin/. In
    Windows, these commands resolve to batch files (.bat); in
    Unix, they resolve to shell scripts (.sh).
    </p>

    <p>This guide assumes you have correctly installed the Fedora
    server distribution as per the install guide, including having
    set up your PATH and FEDORA_HOME appropriately.
    <p>

    <hr size="1"/>
    <p>
    <strong>NOTE: Currently, if you are running Fedora with a servlet container 
    other than Tomcat</strong>, these scripts will need to be manually modified
    for your environment to pick up the paths to the Fedora classes and 
    required libraries from a location other than CATALINA_HOME.

    <h2 id="rebuild">fedora-rebuild</h2>


    <p>Reconstitutes Fedora's indexes (the Resource Index and/or
    the SQL database) from the FOXML and datastream files on disk.</p>

  <p>In case of corruption or failure of the repository, the Fedora Rebuild 
	utility can <strong><em>completely rebuild the repository by crawling the digital 
	object XML source files</em></strong> that are stored on disk.</p>
	
	<p>The fedora-rebuild command launches the interactive Fedora Rebuild 
	utility that restores the repository if it somehow became corrupted. 
	Symptoms of repository corruption include underlying indexes or registries 
	becoming unusable, or the server refusing to start. The 
	components of the repository that can become corrupted are the SQL 
	relational database and the RDF triplestore that underlie the Fedora 
	repository service. The SQL database (e.g., MySQL, McKoi, or 
	Oracle) contains a set of registries, as well as metadata to enable simple 
	searching of the repository, and a cache of digital object profiles to speed 
	up API-A access to the repository. The triplestore contains RDF 
	triples for key properties of digital objects, datastreams, disseminations, 
	and relationships to create an RDF-based index of the repository (used for more advanced 
	RDF-based searching).</p>
	
  <p>In prior versions of Fedora, under some circumstances the SQL relational database 
	component could become corrupt, which would then 
	require the entire repository to be deleted and all of the digital objects 
	in the repository to be manually re-ingested. The Fedora Rebuild utility allows the 
	repository administrator to merely purge the 
	database used by the Fedora server, and re-configure the database (using either mysql-config or mckoi-init)
	and then run the Fedora Rebuild utility to restore the repository to a rational, usable state.
 Additionally, if the administrator wants to change 
	the underlying database system (e.g., change from McKoi to MySQL database, 
	or MySQL to Oracle), the existing database can be purged, the Fedora Configuration 
	File (fedora.fcfg) 
	can be edited, and the Fedora Rebuild utility can then be run to correctly populate the tables in the new
	database system.</p>
	
  <p>Similarly, if the Resource Index becomes corrupted 
    or the Resource Index triplestore files are deleted from disk, then the 
	Fedora Rebuild utility can be used to completely rebuild the Resource Index 
	and bring it back to its desired state.  The Fedora Rebuild utility can also be used 
	to rebuild the Resource Index whenever the <strong><em>indexing level is changed</em></strong> in 
	the Fedora Server Configuration file (see: fedora.fcfg). A rebuild of 
	the Resource Index will recreate the triplestore itself, and also populate 
	utility tables in the SQL database component of Fedora.</p>
	
    <hr size="1"/>
    <p>
    <strong>NOTE: There are some circumstances in which <em>both 
	an SQL rebuild and a Resource Index rebuild must be run.</em></strong>
    </p>
    <hr size="1"/>

	<p>Although the Resource Index is primarily stored in the triplestore that 
	configured with Fedora, it also stores some information in relational database tables 
	(in the same SQL database used by the rest of the Fedora server). For 
	example, if the SQL database becomes severely corrupted 
    such that the entire database needs to be deleted, or if the Fedora administrator plans to switch from using 
    one database system to another, the Fedora Rebuild utility will have to be run twice.
	Once for an SQL Rebuild to recreate and repopulate the tables in the SQL database
    used by the main portion of the Fedora server. Then a second time as a 
	Resource Index rebuild to recreate the triplestore and repopulate the SQL tables used by the 
	Resource Index.</p>
  <p>
  	When you run the Fedora Rebuild utility, a text menu appears, allowing you to specify whether you need to rebuild 
	the SQL database or rebuild the resource index files.  See below for step-by-step descriptions of 
	how to use the rebuild tool in the various instances when it might be needed:
 </p>
	<p><strong>SQL Rebuild:</strong> If the tables in the SQL database used by the Fedora server are corrupted:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Stop the Fedora server (if using Tomcat, this can be done with the 
	    <em>shutdown.bat or shutdown.sh</em> command)</li>
	<li>Run <a href="#rebuild">fedora-rebuild</a> to re-populate SQL database 
	tables used by the Fedora server with the correct information (<strong>select 
	menu option '2'</strong>)</li>
	<li>Restart the Fedora server (if using Tomcat, this can be done with the
        <em>startup.bat or startup.sh</em> command)</li>
	</ol>
	<p><strong>Resource Index Rebuild</strong>: If the Resource Index level is changed, or if the 
	Resource Index is corrupted:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Stop the Fedora server (if using Tomcat, this can be done with the 
	    <em>shutdown.bat or shutdown.sh</em> command)</li>
	<li>Run <a href="#rebuild">fedora-rebuild</a> to re-construct the Resource Index files and the 
	Resource Index tables in the SQL database (<strong>select menu option '1'</strong>)</li>
	<li>Restart the Fedora server (if using Tomcat, this can be done with the
        <em>startup.bat or startup.sh</em> command)</li>
	</ol>
	<p><strong>Both</strong>: If SQL database becomes severely corrupted such that 
	   database is completely unusable, or if a different SQL database 
	   program or version is to be used.</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Stop the Fedora server (if using Tomcat, this can be done with the 
	    <em>shutdown.bat or shutdown.sh</em> command)</li>
	<li>Re-install or initialize the database as per the instructions
	    in the <em><a href="../../distribution/installation.html">Installation and
	    Configuration Guide</a></em>.</li>
	<li>Run <a href="#rebuild">fedora-rebuild</a> to re-populate SQL database 
	tables used by the Fedora server with the correct information (<strong>select 
	menu option '2'</strong>)</li>
	<li>Run <a href="#rebuild">fedora-rebuild</a> <strong>again</strong> to re-construct the 
	Resource Index files and the Resource Index tables in the SQL database (<strong>select 
	menu option '1'</strong>)</li>
	<li>Restart the Fedora server (if using Tomcat, this can be done with the
        <em>startup.bat or startup.sh</em> command)</li>
	</ol>

    <h2 id="reload">fedora-reload-policies</h2>

    <p>Where:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>[http|https]</strong> - Indicates which protocol to use to send the
       "reload policies" signal to the running Fedora server.</li>
      <li><strong>[username]</strong> - An administrative Fedora user with permission
      to reload polcies.</li>
      <li><strong>[password]</strong> - Password for the administrative user.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Causes any new or changed repository-wide policies to take effect
      immediately on the running Fedora server.
    </p>
    <p>As described in the document, 
    <em><a href="../security/AuthorizationXACML.htm">Fedora Authorization with 
    XACML Policy Enforcement</a></em>,
	Fedora can be configured to enforce a variety of access policies.
	Many of these XACML policies are applied for all actions and access 
	attempts peformed on the repository as a whole.  These "repository-wide" 
	XACML policies are automatically loaded at the time the Fedora server is 
	started.  If the Fedora server administrator needs to change one or 
	more of these repository-wide policies, this command can be used to tell 
	the running Fedora server to reload the policies.
	The alternative to using this command is to stop the Fedora server
	and restart it.</p>


    <h2 id="validate">validate-policy</h2>


    <p>Where:</p>

    <ul>
	<li><strong>[policyFilename]</strong> - Name of XACML file containing the new or
	modified policy</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Schema-validates a XACML policy file.
    </p>
    <p>If the Fedora server administrator creates or modifies an existing
    repository-wide XACML policy, the new policy <strong>should</strong> be run through
    this program to ensure that it is well-formed before attempting to
    install it in the Fedora server.  Validating a policy in this way will
    ensure that it is well-formed XML and can follows the XACML XML schema.</p>
