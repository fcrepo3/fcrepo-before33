          As of Fedora 2.1, the Fedora Service Framework was introduced to facilitate the 
integration of new services with the Fedora repository. The framework takes a 
service-oriented architecture approach to building new functionality around a 
Fedora repository. While the Fedora repository, itself, exposes its 
functionality as a set of web service interfaces, all of these interfaces belong 
to the Fedora web application that runs in its own Tomcat. The new Fedora 
Service Framework allows new services to be built around the core repository - 
as stand-alone web applications that run independently of the Fedora 
repository. While Fedora repository functionality can still be extended with 
new modules, the intent is to keep the repository service focused on the core 
functions of a repository. Yet, there are many other services that are 
beneficial companions to a repository, such as specialized ingest services, 
workflow services, preservation services, and many others. These are the kinds 
of services that the framework is intended to support. There are two main 
benefits to the service framework approach: (1) it allows new functionality to 
be added as atomic, modular services that can interact with Fedora repositories, 
yet not be part of the repository, (2) it makes co-development of new services 
for Fedora easier since each service can be independently developed and 
plugged into the framework. As of Fedora 2.1, the Fedora development team has 
released an initial set of services (<a href="http://www.fedora.info/download/2.2/services/diringest/doc/index.html">Directory 
Ingest</a> and <a href="http://www.fedora.info/download/2.2/services/oaiprovider/doc/index.html">
OAI Provider</a> described below), and will continue to develop new services 
over the coarse of Fedora Phase 2 (2005-2007) and beyond, especially services 
for workflow and preservation. Services that are part of the framework will be 
packaged as part of the Fedora open-source software distribution and will be 
kept up to date with new versions of the core Fedora repository service.  
Members of the Fedora community will be collaborating on the development of 
services and will contributed back to the Fedora Project. Further 
documentation will be provided to establish guidelines on how services should be 
designed to effectively plug into the framework. In the mean time, developers 
of new services can follow the design patterns of the Directory Ingest and OAI 
Provider services.

          The Fedora Service Framework establishes a means for coupling new services with 
the core Fedora repository service. The framework allows for the creation of 
atomic, modular services that can interact with the Fedora repository or each 
other. The diagram below depicts the Fedora Service Framework as it is 
envisioned to evolve during 2005-2007. The repository service was the first 
deliverable of the Fedora Project (2002-present). In 2006, the next two 
services were introduced with Fedora 2.1: the OAI Provider Service and the 
Directory Ingest services. In January 2007, the Fedora Search Service is 
being deployed as part of the framework. The Search Service (known as GSearch) 
was contributed to the Fedora Project by community member Gert Schmeltz Pedersen 
of the Danish Technical University. During the rest of Phase 2 of the Fedora Project, both the Fedora development team, and the 
Fedora community will develop the other services to fit into the framework. In 
2007, development will begin on the Fedora Preservation, Event/Messaging, and 
Workflow services. During this phase of development we will move Fedora 
towards an &quot;enterprise&quot; architectural pattern.

          The Fedora Service Framework can evolve to include new services conceived of by 
the Fedora community. Listed below is a brief description of each service, 
links to specifications when available, and status.

the form of a .zip archive that contains directories of files along with a 
METS-based manifest file that describes the directory hierarchy. The default 
parent-child relationships that characterize a directory hierarchy can be 
overridden and refined to have other semantic meaning (e.g., collection-member, 
folder-document). Upon receipt of the SIP, the Directory Ingest service will 
process the .zip archive and create a Fedora digital object in the repository 
for every file and every directory, plus it will record the relationships among 
them in Fedora's RDF-based relationships datastream. <em>A new web-based 
client for creating the SIP is now available (see
	<a href="http://www.fedora.info/download/2.2/services/sipcreator/doc/index.html">

enable a user select files from a file system, add metadata about files, and 
assert semantically-meaningful relationships, and ultimately submit the SIP to a 
Fedora repository.</em>

        <span class="plaintext">
          Fedora Core Repository Service can be run as a stand-alone service, or it can be 
situated within the Fedora Service Framework, where a suite of companion 
services can be loosely coupled with the repository to provide additional 
functionality for integrating the repository into a broader service-oriented 
architecture (SOA) pattern. The core repository can be accessed via web service 
interfaces to its core functionality. The core repository service actually has 
several web service APIs: an interface for repository management (API-M); an 
interface for repository access (API-A); interface for basic repository search; 
and an interface for RDF-based search of the Resource Index. All of these web 
service interfaces are available on the Fedora repository server web application 
that runs in Tomcat. The repository service is built in a modular manner, so 
that each inner function is implemented as a java-based module. The inner 
modules are configurable, and they can be replaced with alternate 
implementations.
<br />
<br />
The Fedora repository service is the core service in the Fedora Service 
Framework, and was depicted in the above diagram in the center of all other 
services. Below, the Fedora repository service is depicted in more detail, 
with its inner modules exposed, and all repository interfaces. The diagram 
depicts the repository service from the perspective of how it maps to the
<a href="http://ssdoo.gsfc.nasa.gov/nost/isoas/">Open Archival Information 
System (OAIS)</a> reference model which has been approved as an ISO standard.
