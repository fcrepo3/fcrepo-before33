      <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        Messaging is a communication mechanism used to send and receive information in a manner which allows the senders
        and receivers to be unaware of the activities or status of the other parties involved in the exchange. This loose
        coupling is achieved through the use of an intermediary queue or topic managed by a messaging provider.
        The messaging provider is responsible for delivering messages sent by message producers to message consumers.
        Messaging in Fedora is implemented using the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jms/">Java Messaging Service (JMS)</a>
        which is a specification used by many messaging providers that allows messages to be sent or received from a queue or
        topic in a generic fashion.
      </p>

      <h2 id="messaging">Messaging in Fedora</h2>

      <p>
      	The goal of messaging in Fedora is to provide updates about the activities of the repository as they occur.
	    This allows external applications to monitor and perform actions based on those activities. In order to provide
	    the capability for multiple independent clients to receive identical update messages simultaneously, an asynchronous
	    publish-and-subscribe model was chosen as the default for Fedora's messaging capability. The messages sent using this
	    model indicate when functions of API-M have been exercised, thus providing information about every update made to
        digital objects within the repository.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fedora uses <a href="http://activemq.apache.org/index.html">Apache ActiveMQ</a> as its default messaging provider.
        While the use of JMS suggests that any messaging provider supporting JMS can replace ActiveMQ, no other providers
        have been tested. If you do use Fedora with another JMS-compliant messaging provider, please
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=177054">let us know</a> your results.
      </p>

      <h2 id="config">Configuring Messaging</h2>

      <p>
        Messaging in Fedora is configured primarily through the messaging module within the fedora.fcfg file. The following
        parameters, specified as part of the messaging module, are required in order to establish a JMS Connection:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>enabled</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Default: false</li>
              <li>Determines whether the messaging module should be initialized in order to send messages. If you want messages
              to be sent, this must be set to true.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>java.naming.factory.initial</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Default: org.apache.activemq.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory</li>
              <li>Specifies the JNDI initial context with which the connection factory and destination administered objects
              will be looked up. As indicated by the default value, Fedora uses <a href="http://activemq.apache.org/index.html">ActiveMQ</a>
              as its default JNDI provider as well as its default messaging provider. The messaging provider and JNDI
              provider do not need to be the same.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>java.naming.provider.url</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Default: tcp://localhost:61616</li>
              <li>Specifies the address at which a connection can be made to the messaging provider. Depending on the
              provider, this address may indicate any of several protocols and may include additional parameters.
              An example from ActiveMQ is - vm://localhost?broker.persistent=false - which indicates the use of
              an internal JVM transport along with non-persistent messages.</li>
              <li>Fedora will attempt to connect to the messaging provider at this address on startup, so make sure
              that your provider is running and available.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>connection.factory.name</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Default: ConnectionFactory</li>
              <li>Specifies the JNDI name of the ConnectionFactory object needed to create a connection to the JMS
              provider. ActiveMQ creates a connection factory on startup and stores it under the name ConnectionFactory
              in its included JNDI provider. If you are using a different JMS or JNDI provider, you will need to create
              a connection factory in JNDI and specify the name under which it is stored as the value of this parameter.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
		</ul>
      </p>

      <p>
         Once a connection is established to the JMS provider, Fedora needs to know where to publish messages.
         Two topics are currently available for this purpose:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>fedora.apim.update</strong> - API-M methods which cause an update to occur within the repository. This
            includes all ingest, add, modify, set, and purge activities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>fedora.apim.access</strong> - API-M methods which access the repository but do not cause an update
          	to occur. This includes all methods not considered updates.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        The names of these topics may be changed by specifying new values for the name parameter of the apimUpdateMessages
        and apimAccessMessages datastores within the fedora.fcfg file. Changing the names will not alter the messages being
        sent but will send those messages to different destinations.
      </p>
      <p>
      	If a point-to-point messaging model is preferred, the type parameters of the datastores mentioned above can be changed
      	to "queue", which will result in the messages being placed in a queue of the name specified in the datastore. Queues
      	allow only a single entity to retrieve and process each message, but they do remove timing dependencies inherent with
      	the publish-and-subscribe model (subscribers must register their interest prior to a message being published in order
      	to receive that message.)
      </p>

      <h2 id="client">Messaging Client</h2>

      <p>
        In order to receive the messages that are being sent by Fedora, you will need to create a message consumer to listen
        for Fedora's notification messages. To aid in this effort, the Messaging Client was created. To build the Messaging Client,
        run the messaging-client Ant target from the source distribution. After the build completes, look in the
        dist directory for fedora-messaging-client.zip, which includes all of the jars necessary to use the Fedora
        Messaging Client. If you are using a messaging provider other than ActiveMQ, you will need to replace the activemq-all
        jar with the appropriate jars from your messaging provider of choice.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Messaging Client was designed to provide a simple Java interface for receiving messages from Fedora. Some configuration
        parameters are necessary in order for the client to create a connection and listen to the appropriate topic or queue. The parameter
        names here are the same as those listed above for messaging, and the values should be the same as those in your fedora.fcfg
        file. The topic or queue name(s) on which to listen are also included as parameters and the value(s) should match those
        in the fedora.fcfg datastores. If you are using ActiveMQ as your JMS and JNDI providers each topic or queue will be created for
        you, otherwise you will need to create destination object(s) in JNDI to match the property values you specify here.

        <ul>
          <li><strong>java.naming.factory.initial</strong> - this String value can be found in javax.naming.Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY</li>
          <li><strong>java.naming.provider.url</strong> - this String value can be found in javax.naming.Context.PROVIDER_URL</li>
          <li><strong>connection.factory.name</strong> - this String value can be found in fedora.server.messaging.JMSManager.CONNECTION_FACTORY_NAME</li>
          <li><strong>topic.{name} OR queue.{name}</strong> - topics are specified using the prefix "topic." followed by a topic name.
          Queues are specified using the prefix "queue." followed by a queue name.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        The code below is a simple example of how to use the Messaging Client. The JmsMessagingClient constructor includes three
        required parameters and two optional parameters. The required parameters include the client ID, the MessagingListener instance,
        and the connection properties mentioned above. The optional parameters include a message selector and flag which determines
        whether durable subscribers should be used to listen over the topics listed in the properties.
        More information about each of the available parameters can be found in the JmsMessagingClient javadocs.

      <h2 id="messages">Messages</h2>

      <p>
        The content of messages sent by Fedora takes the form of feed entries based on the
        <a href="http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/syndication/">Atom Syndication Format</a>. These messages
        correspond to API-M method calls, indicating the name of the method, its parameters, return value, and
        other information about the method. Each message will be similar to the following example:
      </p>

      <p>
        The Atom tags in each message will have the following values:
        <ul>
          <li>&lt;id&gt; uniquely identifies each entry</li>
          <li>&lt;updated&gt; indicates the date and time at which the call occurred
          <li>&lt;author&gt; identifies the initiation point of the API-M method call
            <ul>
              <li>&lt;name&gt; specifies the name of the user making the call
              <li>&lt;uri&gt; corresponds to the baseURL of the Fedora
              repository from which the call originated</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>&lt;title&gt; specifies the method name</li>
          <li>Each &lt;category&gt; corresponds to a method's argument:
            <ul>
              <li>The term indicates the argument value. However, null values are
              indicated as "null", and non-null <code>xsd:base64Binary</code> values are
              indicated as "[OMITTED]".</li>
              <li>The scheme indicates the argument name</li>
              <li>The label indicates the argument datatype</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>&lt;summary&gt; corresponds to the PID of the object operated on by the method, if applicable.</li>
          <li>&lt;content&gt; corresponds to the textual representation of the method's
          return value, noting the following:
            <ul>
              <li>Null values are represented as "null".</li>
              <li><code>fedora-types:ArrayOfString</code> values are represented as a
              comma-separated list, e.g. "value1, value2, value3".</li>
              <li>Non-null <code>xsd:base64Binary</code> values are not returned, and
              only indicated as "[OMITTED]".</li>
              <li>Non-null <code>fedora-types:Datastream</code> values are not returned,
              and only indicated as "[OMITTED]".</li>
              <li><code>fedora-types:RelationshipTuple</code> values are represented in
              Notation3 (N3).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Two properties are included as part of each JMS message produced by Fedora, primarily for use by message selectors.
        These two properties are: <strong>methodName</strong> and <strong>pid</strong>. A message selector, which can be
        specified using the Messaging Client, is used to limit the messages that will be delievered based on selection criteria.
        An example of a message selector is: "methodName LIKE 'purge%'". This selector would limit the messages received by
        the client to only those messages for which the method is a purge (purgeObject and purgeDatastream.)
