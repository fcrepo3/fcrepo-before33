                      modern unix installations by default.  For windows users,
                      and those new to CVS, you can download and read about
                      it at
                      <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/" target="_top">cvshome.org</a>.
                      From this point forward, this guide assumes your have
                      the 'cvs' executable in your PATH, although your
                      partciular IDE may already integrate CVS support. You
                      may wish to consult

                      communication with the source code repository.  Modern
                      unix installations usually come with ssh(1) and
                      ssh-keygen installed.  Windows users can download an SSH
                      client called Putty from
                      <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html" target="_top">this
                      site</a>.  If you're a Windows user and you don't
                      already have an SSH client and RSA key generator, go
                      ahead and download (at least) putty, plink, pageant,
                      and puttygen from that site.  The remainder of this guide

                      They will be downloaded when you first perform a

                      source code is finally made public, some of these tools
                      may need to be removed from CVS in order to comply with
                      their licenses for redistribution.  When that time comes,
                      instructions will be included in this gude on what the
                      tools are, how to get them, and where to put them so

                          through the process.  Make sure your public and
                          private keys are saved in a place that ssh(1) will
                          look (usually ~/.ssh, which is the default)</p><p>Note for both Windows and Unix users: using a
                          passphrase on your private key isn't necessary if
                          you keep your private key file secure (readable
                          only by you).  If you decide to use a key passphrase,
                          make it anything you want, and note that whenever
                          you use your private key, you'll need to manually
                          provide that passphrase.</p><p>Now upload your public key to

                          be used by the putty ssh client (plink).  It runs in
                          the background.  Bring the pageant window to the

                      The 'file type' grouping used at this directory level
                      is the only one dictated outside the build.xml (ant) file.
                      Groupings inside these directories are not necessary,
                      but may be useful during compilation (for example, the
                      java directory is organized by package because the java
                      compiler expects it to be that way)  Note that file
                      type should usually be based on mime type distinctions,
                      and if there is a standard file extension for the
                      particular type, that should be used.  For xml files
                      that don't have a well-established extension, rather
                      than putting them all in xml, put them in a directory
                      using some obvious identifier for their schema namespace
                      (but non-version specific, to be consistent with file
                      extension conventions).</p><p>&lt;&lt;TODO: At the end of this list, insert other
                      types, with brief descriptions and directory structure

            most common tasks you'll use in CVS, biased to the Fedora
            development environment.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e379"></a>Get a Working Copy (one-time)</h3></div></div><p><b><tt>cvs co -P mellon</tt></b></p><p>This example brings a copy of the entire mellon subtree (all
              project files) on to your system, creating the "mellon" directory
              (and sub-directories) if needed.  You only need to do this once
              per working copy.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e387"></a>Getting the Latest Copy of a File from the Repository</h3></div></div><p><b><tt>cvs update -d YourFile.java</tt></b></p><p>You can also do this recursively on entire directories by
              specifying a directory instead of a file. The -d tells it to
              get newly created directories, which is usually what you want.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e395"></a>Checking in (committing) a changed file.</h3></div></div><p><b><tt>cvs ci -m "I changed that one part"
              YourFile.java</tt></b></p><p>This example checks in a changed file, using a log message.  If
              you want a multi-line log message, you can type this same
              command, but don't include the <b><tt>-m "message"</tt></b>
              part.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e406"></a>Adding a File</h3></div></div><p><b><tt>cvs add [-kb] MyFile.java</tt></b></p><p>This example adds the file MyFile.java to the repository.  Before
              a file is available to others for the first time, it must
              <span class="emphasis"><em>also</em></span> be checked in. </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>If a file
              is binary, <span class="emphasis"><em>you must use <b><tt>-kb</tt></b>
              </em></span> or the file will be mangled in the repository.
              For normal text files, you should not use
              <b><tt>-kb</tt></b>.</div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e428"></a>Removing a File</h3></div></div><p><b><tt>cvs rm -f MyFile.java</tt></b></p><p>The <b><tt>-f</tt></b> option tells CVS that before
              removing it from the repository, it should remove it from your
              working directory.  If you don't specify
              <b><tt>-f</tt></b>, you must have already deleted the file
              from your working directory or this command will not run.
              Directories are deleted in the same way.  Remove operations must
              be committed to take effect in the repository.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>Under normal circumstances, deleted files can be recovered from
              the repository, so the delete operation will only make the file
              invisible to those who have the most recent copy of the code.
              You may check out an old version of the deleted file at
              any time.</div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e444"></a>Locking</h3></div></div><p>CVS allows for the concurrent modifications to working copies
              of files.  This is not always a bad thing, but can create
              confusion and re-work headaches without adequate developer
              communication.</p><p>To remedy this, some people have written extensions to CVS
              that allow for strict locking (the default practice in most
              revision control systems), but these extensions are not available
              in our environment.</p><p>The other approach (which our environment supports) is to use a
              method called <span class="emphasis"><em>weak locking</em></span>.  Weak locking
              is supported by the cvs commands <span class="emphasis"><em>edit</em></span>,
              <span class="emphasis"><em>unedit</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>watch</em></span>,
              and <span class="emphasis"><em>watchers</em></span>.</p><p>In weak locking, the repository provides several functions that
              aid in developer communication so we can see what people are
              working on.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e470"></a>edit</h4></div></div><p><b><tt>cvs edit
                  MyFile.java</tt></b></p><p>Signals that you intend to edit this file.  This creates
                  what is called a "temporary watch" on the file, which
                  signifies to other developers that you are working
                  on the file.  It also has the effect of "watch" until you
                  "unedit" the file.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e478"></a>unedit</h4></div></div><p><b><tt>cvs unedit MyFile.java</tt></b></p><p>Cancels the effect of a cvs "edit".  This doesn't
                  revert your changes -- it just signals to the repository
                  that you are not an editor of this file.  This is typically
                  done after you have made changes and committed a file
                  and are moving on to something else, or you've decided that
                  you're no longer interested in changing the file.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e486"></a>watch</h4></div></div><p><b><tt>cvs watch [add|remove]</tt></b></p><p>Adds you to (or removes you from) the list of "watchers" for
                  all actions on this file.  If the repository is configured to
                  do email notification (currently not the case), you will get
                  an email any time someone does something with the file in
                  the repository.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e494"></a>watchers</h4></div></div><p><b><tt>cvs watchers MyFile.java</tt></b></p><p>Lists the people who are watching the file.
                  This will include anyone who has a temporary watch, too
                  (someone who is editing the file).  It is a good idea to do
                  this before editing a file to make sure nobody else is working
                  on it at the same time. (Unless you've co-ordinated with someone
                  to do concurrent mods on separate sections of the file, in which
                  case CVS will do the merging for you at commit-time)</p></div></div></div><div class="appendix"><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e502"></a>B. Revision History</h2><p>Here is the revision history of this guide:</p><div class="literallayout"><p><br>
