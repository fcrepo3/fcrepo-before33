  <div class="article"> 
    <div class="sect1">3. Distribution Obligations. <br>
      3.1. Application of License. <br>
      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed 
      by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. 
      The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the 
      terms of this License or a future version of this License released under 
      Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy 
      of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms 
      on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version 
      of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include 
      an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 
      3.5. <br>
      3.2. Availability of Source Code. <br>
      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made 
      available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on 
      the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution 
      Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and 
      if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available 
      for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, 
      or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular 
      Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible 
      for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the 
      Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. <br>
      3.3. Description of Modifications. <br>
      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file 
      documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date 
      of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification 
      is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial 
      Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source 
      Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation 
      in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. <br>
      3.4. Intellectual Property Matters <br>
      (a) Third Party Claims. <br>
      If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual 
      property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor 
      under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the 
      Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL'' which describes the claim 
      and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will 
      know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification 
      is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly 
      modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter 
      and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists 
      or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered 
      Code that new knowledge has been obtained. <br>
      (b) Contributor APIs. <br>
      If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface 
      and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary 
      to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in 
      the LEGAL file. <br>
      <br>
      (c) Representations. <br>
      Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) 
      above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's 
      original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the 
      rights conveyed by this License.<br>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="article">
    <div class="sect1">3.5. Required Notices. <br>
      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. 
      If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file 
      due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such 
      as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a 
      notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name 
      as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate 
      this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe 
      recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may 
      choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or 
      liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, 
      You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial 
      Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any 
      such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by 
      You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every 
      Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such 
      Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms 
      You offer. <br>
      3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. <br>
      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements 
      of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include 
      a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available 
      under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where 
      You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously 
      included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or 
      collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered 
      Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership 
      rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different 
      from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of 
      this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt 
      to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from 
      the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version 
      under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms 
      which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial 
      Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial 
      Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial 
      Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. <br>
      3.7. Larger Works. <br>
      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not 
      governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as 
      a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of 
      this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.<br>
      4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. <br>
      If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License 
      with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial 
      order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License 
      to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the 
      code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described 
      in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source 
      Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description 
      must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able 
      to understand it.<br>
      5. Application of this License. <br>
      This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached 
      the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.<br>
      6. Versions of the License. <br>
      6.1. New Versions. <br>
      Netscape Communications Corporation (''Netscape'') may publish revised and/or 
      new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given 
      a distinguishing version number. <br>
      6.2. Effect of New Versions. <br>
      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, 
      You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may 
      also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version 
      of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the 
      right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this 
      License. <br>
      6.3. Derivative Works. <br>
      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only 
      do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed 
      by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ''Mozilla'', 
      ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', &quot;MPL&quot;, ''NPL'' or any 
      confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note 
      that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear 
      that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla 
      Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the 
      Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described 
      in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this 
      License.)<br>
      7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. <br>
      COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT 
      WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
      WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR 
      A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY 
      AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE 
      PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER 
      CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
      THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. 
      NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.<br>
      8. TERMINATION. <br>
      8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically 
      if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 
      30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered 
      Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. 
      Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination 
      of this License shall survive. <br>
      8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim 
      (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor 
      (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action 
      is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;) alleging that: <br>
      (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes 
      any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under 
      Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from 
      Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt 
      of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually 
      agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications 
      made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect 
      to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of 
      notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed 
      upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, 
      the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically 
      terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. 
      <br>
      (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor 
      Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted 
      to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked 
      effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had 
      made, Modifications made by that Participant. <br>
      8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging 
      that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes 
      any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) 
      prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable 
      value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 
      2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any 
      payment or license. <br>
      8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end 
      user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have 
      been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination 
      shall survive termination.<br>
      9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. <br>
      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING 
      NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY 
      OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF 
      ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, 
      INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
      LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE 
      OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN 
      IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
      THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL 
      INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW 
      PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION 
      OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION 
      AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
      10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. <br>
      The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 
      C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer software'' 
      and ''commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used 
      in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 
      C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End 
      Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.<br>
      11. MISCELLANEOUS. <br>
      This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter 
      hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such 
      provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. 
      This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the 
      extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law 
      provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen 
      of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States 
      of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to 
      the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, 
      with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party 
      responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable 
      attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention 
      on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. 
      Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall 
      be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.<br>
      12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. <br>
      As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible 
      for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization 
      of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer 
      and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. 
      Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission 
      of liability.<br>
      13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. <br>
      Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as &quot;Multiple-Licensed&quot;. 
      &quot;Multiple-Licensed&quot; means that the Initial Developer permits you 
      to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the MPL or 
      the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in 
      the file described in Exhibit A.</div>

      The contents of the downloaded file (saxon.zip), with the exception of the 
      &AElig;lfred parser (see below), are subject to the Mozilla Public License 
      Version 1.0 (the &quot;License&quot;); you may not use this file except

      License for the specific language governing rights and limitations under 
      the License.<br>
      The Original Code of SAXON comprises all those components which are not 
      explicitly attributed to other parties. It does not include the &AElig;lfred 
      parser, which is redistributed under the licence described below.<br>
      The Initial Developer of the Original Code was Michael Kay of International 
      Computers Limited. Individual modules identified as being created by James 
      Clark, David Megginson, or John Cowan include separate IPR notices. All 
      Rights Reserved.<br>
      Since February 2001 I (Michael Kay) have been an employee of Software AG, 
      and I continue to develop Saxon with the support and sponsorship of that 
      company. Technically, therefore, the &quot;Initial Developer&quot; no longer 
      exists (the form of words was deliberately chosen to reflect the joint involvement 
      of myself and ICL), so I now work as a &quot;Contributor&quot;. Other contributors 
      are acknowledged individually in comments attached to the relevant code 
      modules. <br>
      iclway is an Internet Service Provider operated by ICL; however, the fact 
      that I continue to use this ISP for hosting Saxon does not imply that ICL 
      have any interest in the content of the site. Equally, for reasons of continuity, 
      I have kept the icl.com domain name in package names and namespace URIs 
      with the tacit consent of ICL, but this should not be taken to imply any 
      ongoing ICL involvement.<br>
      If you produce a product that includes or requires SAXON, please refer to 
      it as &quot;The SAXON XSLT Processor from Michael Kay&quot;, and include 
      the URL of the home page, which is at <a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net">http://saxon.sourceforge.net/</a>.<br>
      There is no guarantee of technical support, though I am usually able to 
      answer enquiries within a few days. Please subscribe to the mailing list 
      available at <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/saxon-help">http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/saxon-help</a> 
      and raise any enquiries there. Also check the Saxon project pages on sourceforge 
      for details of known errors; all bugs are listed there as soon as I have 
      sufficient evidence to describe the nature of the problem.</p>
    <p>&AElig;lfred<br>
      Included in the Saxon distribution is a modified version of the &AElig;lfred 
      XML parser from Microstar. I have taken the relevant part of David Brownell's 
      &AElig;lfred2 distribution, repackaged it, and fixed a few bugs. All cahnges 
      are clearly documented in the source code.<br>
      This is distributed under the terms of Microstar's terms and conditions, 
      which are as follows: <br>

      The version included with Saxon is David Brownell's code of 26 Feb 2000, 
      modified as follows:<br>
      * Changed the package name to com.icl.saxon.aelfred to prevent any accidental 
      confusion with the original Microstar code or with David Brownell's version.<br>
      * Fixed several bugs: (1) a bug in namespace handling (where an attribute 
      xxx:name precedes the xmlns:xxx declaration) (2) poor diagnostics when end 
      of file occurs prematurely <br>
      * Subsetting the code to include only the XML non-validating parser and 
      SAX driver, with appropriate changes to the setFeature() and getFeature() 
      methods.<br>
      * Some further changes made by David Brownell up to June 2001 have been 
      incorporated.</p>
    <p>Saxon Servlet<br>
      Included in this distribution is a modified version of the Saxon Servlet 
      Adapted from the SaxonServlet.java example file contained in the source 
      distribution of &quot;The SAXON XSLT Processor from Michael Kay&quot;.</p>

      OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, 
      HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR 
      RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN 
      ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event will Sun's liability 
      to you, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, 
      exceed the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement. The foregoing 
      limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its essential 
      purpose. <br>
      6. Termination. This Agreement is effective until terminated. You may terminate 
      this Agreement at any time by destroying all copies of Software. This Agreement 
      will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you fail to comply 
      with any provision of this Agreement. Upon Termination, you must destroy 
      all copies of Software. <br>
      7. Export Regulations. All Software and technical data delivered under this 
      Agreement are subject to US export control laws and may be subject to export 
      or import regulations in other countries. You agree to comply strictly with 
      all such laws and regulations and acknowledge that you have the responsibility 
      to obtain such licenses to export, re-export, or import as may be required 
      after delivery to you. <br>
      8. U.S. Government Restricted Rights. If Software is being acquired by or 
      on behalf of the U.S. Government or by a U.S. Government prime contractor 
      or subcontractor (at any tier), then the Government's rights in Software 
      and accompanying documentation will be only as set forth in this Agreement; 
      this is in accordance with 48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department 
      of Defense (DOD) acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD 
      acquisitions). <br>
      9. Governing Law. Any action related to this Agreement will be governed 
      by California law and controlling U.S. federal law. No choice of law rules 
      of any jurisdiction will apply. <br>
      10. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, 
      this Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless 
      omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this Agreement 
      will immediately terminate. <br>
      11. Integration. This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and 
      Sun relating to its subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous 
      oral or written communications, proposals, representations and warranties 
      and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, 
      acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating to its 
      subject matter during the term of this Agreement. No modification of this 
      Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and signed by an authorized 
      representative of each party. <br>

      in the Agreement, or in any license contained within the Software. <br>
      1. Software Internal Use and Development License Grant. Subject to the terms 
      and conditions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to Section 
      3 (Java(TM) Technology Restrictions) of these Supplemental Terms, Sun grants 
      you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to reproduce internally 
      and use internally the binary form of the Software complete and unmodified 
      for the sole purpose of designing, developing and testing your Java applets 
      and applications intended to run on the Java platform (&quot;Programs&quot;). 
      <br>
      2. License to Distribute Software. In addition to the license granted in 
      Section 1 (Software Internal Use and Development License Grant) of these 
      Supplemental Terms, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, 
      including but not limited to Section 3 (Java Technology Restrictions) of 
      these Supplemental Terms, Sun grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, 
      limited license to reproduce and distribute the Software in binary code 
      form only, provided that you (i) distribute the Software complete and unmodified 
      and only bundled as part of your Programs, (ii) do not distribute additional 
      software intended to replace any component(s) of the Software, (iii) do 
      not remove or alter any proprietary legends or notices contained in the 
      Software, (iv) only distribute the Software subject to a license agreement 
      that protects Sun's interests consistent with the terms contained in this 
      Agreement, and (v) agree to defend and indemnify Sun and its licensors from 
      and against any damages, costs, liabilities, settlement amounts and/or expenses 
      (including attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with any claim, lawsuit 
      or action by any third party that arises or results from the use or distribution 
      of any and all Programs and/or Software. <br>
      3. Java Technology Restrictions. You may not modify the Java Platform Interface

      additional classes within the JPI or otherwise causing the addition to or 
      modification of the classes in the JPI. In the event that you create an 
      additional class and associated API(s) which (i) extends the functionality 
      of the Java platform, and (ii) is exposed to third party software developers 
      for the purpose of developing additional software which invokes such additional 
      API, you must promptly publish broadly an accurate specification for such 
      API for free use by all developers. You may not create, or authorize your 
      licensees to create, additional classes, interfaces, or subpackages that 
      are in any way identified as &quot;java&quot;, &quot;javax&quot;, &quot;sun&quot; 
      or similar convention as specified by Sun in any naming convention designation.
